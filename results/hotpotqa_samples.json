The tribe was described in 2000 by Alan Meerow \"et al.\" as a result of a molecular phylogenetic study of the American Amaryllidoideae.  This demonstrated that the Stenomesseae tribe, including the type genus \"Stenomesson\" was polyphyletic.  Part of the tribe segregated with the Eucharideae and were submerged into it, while the other part formed a unique subclade.  Since the type species of \"Stenomesson\" was not part of the second sublclade it was necessary to form a new name for the remaining species together with the other genera that remained.  This was \"Clinanthus\", the oldest name for these species, and consequently the tribe Clinantheae. Arctotis is a genus of annual and perennial plants in the family Asteraceae. Stenomesseae was a tribe (in the family Amaryllidaceae, subfamily Amaryllidoideae), where it forms part of the Andean clade, one of two American clades.  The tribe was originally described by Traub in his monograph on the Amaryllidaceae in 1963, as Stenomessae based on the type genus \"Stenomesson\".  In 1995 it was recognised that Eustephieae was a distinct group separate from the other Stenomesseae.  Subsequently, the M\u00fcller-Doblies' (1996) divided tribe Eustephieae into two subtribes, Stenomessinae and Eustephiinae. Stenomesson is a genus of bulbous plants in the family Amaryllidaceae.

It is the simplest of the Lake District mountains of this height to ascend (as there is a well-trodden tourist track from a car park to the north-east of Keswick, near the summit of Latrigg) and, as such, many walking guides recommend it to the occasional walker wishing to climb a mountain.  This is the first summit of the fell running challenge known as the Bob Graham Round when undertaken in a clockwise direction. Aspatria is a civil parish in the non-metropolitan district of Allerdale, and is currently embraced in the Parliamentary constituency of Workington.  Historically within Cumberland the town rests on the north side of the Ellen Valley, overlooking a panoramic view of the countryside, with Skiddaw to the South and the Solway Firth to the North.

The better known of the two, \"Amaryllis belladonna\", is a native of the Western Cape region of South Africa, particularly the rocky southwest area between the Olifants River Valley to Knysna.  For many years there was confusion among botanists over the generic names \"Amaryllis\" and \"Hippeastrum\", one result of which is that the common name \"amaryllis\" is mainly used for cultivars of the genus \"Hippeastrum\", widely sold in the winter months for their ability to bloom indoors.  Plants of the genus \"Amaryllis\" are known as belladonna lily, Jersey lily, naked lady, amarillo, Easter lily in Southern Australia or, in South Africa, March lily due to its propensity to flower around March.  This is one of numerous genera with the common name \"lily\" due to their flower shape and growth habit.  However, they are only distantly related to the true lily, \"Lilium\". Hippeastrum is a genus of about 90 species and over 600 hybrids and cultivars of perennial herbaceous bulbous plants.  They generally have large fleshy bulbs and tall broad leaves, generally evergreen, and large red or purple flowers. Codariocalyx is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae.  It belongs to the subfamily Faboideae.  This genus has been largely debated with the genus \"Desmodium\" on whether they are separate or the same genus. Desmodium is a genus in the flowering plant family Fabaceae, sometimes called tick-trefoil, tick clover, hitch hikers or beggar lice.

This surname's history can be traced back to as early as the 12th century where it was held by many nobles and people of great importance.  Information on the Gosteli surname turns up randomly within the Swiss Confederation and throughout Switzerland's history.  Due to the lack of record keeping in early times, most of the history is not well documented until the year 1500.  One of the early Gosteli families listed is Jakob Gosteli, born around 1522 in Bolligen, Bern, Switzerland.  His family consisted of wife, Christina Schmid, and 3 sons & 3 daughters: Martin, Michael, Niklaus, Barbli, Christine, and Barbel.  Through canton and church records, many Gosteli family lines can be traced to this point. Jamar Martin (born April 12, 1980 in Canton, Ohio) is a former National Football League fullback.

        "context": "The English Mastiff is a breed of extremely large dog (often known simply as the Mastiff) perhaps descended from the ancient Alaunt and Pugnaces Britanniae, with a significant input from the Alpine Mastiff in the 19th century.  Distinguishable by enormous size, massive head, and a limited range of colours, but always displaying a black mask, the Mastiff is noted for its gentle and loving nature.  The lineage of modern dogs can be traced back to the early 19th century, but the modern type was stabilised in the 1880s and refined since.  Following a period of sharp decline, the Mastiff has increased its worldwide popularity.  Throughout its history, the Mastiff has contributed to the development of a number of dog breeds, some generally known as Mastiff-type dogs, or, confusingly, just as \"Mastiffs\". The Alpine Mastiff is an extinct Molosser dog breed, the progenitor of the St. Bernard, and a major contributor to the modern Mastiff (through such dogs as \"Couchez\"), as well as to other breeds that derive from these breeds or are closely related to them.  M.B. Wynn wrote, \"In 1829 a vast light brindle dog of the old Alpine mastiff breed, named L'Ami, was brought from the convent of Great St. Bernard, and exhibited in London and Liverpool as the largest dog in England.\"  William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire, is believed to have bred Alpine Mastiffs at Chatsworth House.

Eranthemum pulchellum (\"Eranthemum nervosum\", English: blue eranthemum, or blue sage) is a strongly branched shrub, popular with gardeners in tropical India and China because of the spikes of flowers that are bright gentian blue - an unusual color in the tropics.  The flowers appear from green-and-white veined bracts that remain after the blooms fall, forming a column several inches long.  The hairy leaves are large and dark green.  A sprawling shrub which may reach a metre or more in height, \"E. pulchellum\" is usually kept lower and bushier through pruning.  Light shade is preferred in a garden; in a greenhouse it needs warm conditions.  It is easily propagated from cuttings.  According to ITIS, \"Eranthemum pulchellum\" is the only species in the genus Eranthemum although The Plant List accepts 22 species."

In some species of ferns, there is virtually no difference between the fertile and sterile fronds, such as in the genus \"Dryopteris\", other than the mere presence of the sori, or fruit-dots, on the back of the fronds.  Some other species, such as \"Polystichum acrostichoides\" (Christmas fern), or some ferns of the genus \"Osmunda\", feature dimorphism on a portion of the frond only.  Others, such as some species of \"Blechnum\" and \"Woodwardia\", have fertile fronds that are markedly taller than the sterile.  Still others, such as \"Osmunda cinnamomea\" (Cinnamon fern), or plants of the family Onocleaceae, have fertile fronds that are completely different from the sterile.

Lolines increase resistance of endophyte-infected grasses to insect herbivores, and may also protect the infected plants from environmental stresses such as drought and spatial competition.  They are alkaloids, organic compounds containing basic nitrogen atoms.  The basic chemical structure of the lolines comprises a saturated pyrrolizidine ring, a primary amine at the C-1 carbon, and an internal ether bridge\u2014a hallmark feature of the lolines, which is uncommon in organic compounds\u2014joining two distant ring (C-2 and C-7) carbons (see Fig. 1).  Different substituents at the C-1 amine, such as methyl, formyl, and acetyl groups, yield loline species that have variable bioactivity against insects.  Besides endophyte\u2013grass symbiota, loline alkaloids have also been identified in some other plant species; namely, \"Adenocarpus\" species (family Fabaceae) and \"Argyreia mollis\" (family Convolvulaceae)."

The term has been used by forensic and physical anthropologists to refer to individuals and populations that share certain morphological and skeletal traits that are frequent among populations in most of Sub-Saharan Africa and isolated parts of Southeast Asia (Negritos).  First introduced in early racial science and anthropometry, \"Negroid\" denoted one of the three purported major races of humankind (alongside Caucasoid and Mongoloid).  Many social scientists have argued that such analyses are rooted in sociopolitical and historical processes rather than in empirical observation.  However, \"Negroid\" as a biological classification remains in use in forensic anthropology. In Brazil, a sarar\u00e1 (] or ] ) is a multiracial person, being a particular kind of \"mulato\" or \"ju\u00e7ara\" (a tri-racial pardo with Amerindian features), with perceivable Negroid facial features, light complexion and fair but curly hair, called \"cabelo crespo\", or fair but Afro-like frizzly hair, called \"carapinha\", \"cabelo encarapinhado\" or \"cabelo pixaim\" (] ).
