    "In law, an answer was originally a solemn assertion in opposition to someone or something, and thus generally any counter-statement or defense, a reply to a question or response, or objection, or a correct solution of a problem.\n\nIn the common law, an answer is the first pleading by a defendant, usually filed and served upon the plaintiff within a certain strict time limit after a civil complaint or criminal information or indictment has been served upon the defendant.  It may have been preceded by an optional \"pre-answer\" motion to dismiss or demurrer; if such a motion is unsuccessful, the defendant must file an answer to the complaint or risk an adverse default judgment.\n\nIn a criminal case, there is usually an arraignment or some other kind of appearance before the defendant comes to court.  The pleading in the criminal case, which is entered on the record in open court, is usually either guilty or not guilty. Generally speaking in private, civil cases there is no plea entered of guilt or innocence. There is only a judgment that grants money damages or some other kind of equitable remedy such as restitution or a permanent injunction. Criminal cases may lead to fines or other punishment, such as imprisonment.\n\nThe famous Latin Responsa Prudentium (\"answers of the learned ones\") were the accumulated views of many successive generations of Roman lawyers, a body of legal opinion which gradually became authoritative.\n\nDuring debates of a contentious nature, deflection, colloquially known as 'changing the topic', has been widely observed, and is often seen as a failure to answer a question.\n\nNotes\n\nCommon law\nLegal documents",

    "The foreign relations of Angola are based on Angola's strong support of U.S. foreign policy as the Angolan economy is dependent on U.S. foreign aid.\nFrom 1975 to 1989, Angola was aligned with the Eastern bloc, in particular the Soviet Union, Libya, and Cuba. Since then, it has focused on improving relationships with Western countries, cultivating links with other Portuguese-speaking countries, and asserting its own national interests in Central Africa through military and diplomatic intervention. In 1993, it established formal diplomatic relations with the United States. It has entered the Southern African Development Community as a vehicle for improving ties with its largely Anglophone neighbors to the south. Zimbabwe and Namibia joined Angola in its military intervention in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where Angolan troops remain in support of the Joseph Kabila government. It also has intervened in the Republic of the Congo (Brazzaville) in support of Denis Sassou-Nguesso in the civil war.\n\nSince 1998, Angola has successfully worked with the United Nations Security Council to impose and carry out sanctions on UNITA. More recently, it has extended those efforts to controls on conflict diamonds, the primary source of revenue for UNITA during the Civil War that ended in 2002. At the same time, Angola has promoted the revival of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries (CPLP) as a forum for cultural exchange and expanding ties with Portugal (its former ruler) and Brazil (which shares many cultural affinities with Angola) in particular. Angola is a member of the Port Management Association of Eastern and Southern Africa (PMAESA).\n\nDiplomatic relations \nList of countries with which Angola maintains diplomatic relations with:\n\nBilateral relations\n\nAfrica\n\nAmericas\n\nAsia\n\nEurope\n\nSee also \n List of diplomatic missions in Angola\n List of diplomatic missions of Angola\n Visa requirements for Angolan citizens\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links",

    "In law, an abstract is a brief statement that contains the most important points of a long legal document or of several related legal papers.\n\nTypes of legislation \n\nThe abstract of title, used in real estate transactions, is the more common form of abstract. An abstract of title lists all the owners of a piece of land, a house, or a building before it came into possession of the present owner.

An abstract describes a chain of transfers from owner to owner and any agreements by former owners that are binding on later owners.\n\nPatent law\nIn the context of patent law and specifically in prior art searches, searching through abstracts is a common way to find relevant prior art document to question to novelty or inventive step (or non-obviousness in United States patent law) of an invention.

    "The anthophytes are a paraphyletic grouping of plant taxa bearing flower-like reproductive structures. The group, once thought to be a clade, contained the angiosperms - the extant flowering plants, such as roses and grasses - as well as the Gnetales and the extinct Bennettitales.\n\nDetailed morphological and molecular studies have shown that the group is not actually monophyletic, with proposed floral homologies of the gnetophytes and the angiosperms having evolved in parallel.  This makes it easier to reconcile molecular clock data that suggests that the angiosperms diverged from the gymnosperms around 320-300 mya.\n\nSome more recent studies have used the word anthophyte to describe a hypothetical group which includes the angiosperms and a variety of extinct seed plant groups (with various suggestions including at least some of the following groups: glossopterids, corystosperms, Petriellales Pentoxylales, Bennettitales and Caytoniales), but not the Gnetales.\n\nReferences\n\nHistorically recognized plant taxa",

    "\"American shot\" or \"cowboy shot\" is a translation of a phrase from French film criticism, , and refers to a medium-long (\"knee\") film shot of a group of characters, who are arranged so that all are visible to the camera. The usual arrangement is for the actors to stand in an irregular line from one side of the screen to the other, with the actors at the end coming forward a little and standing more in profile than the others. The purpose of the composition is to allow complex dialogue scenes to be played out without changes in camera position. In some literature, this is simply referred to as a 3/4 shot.\n\nOne of the other main reasons why French critics called it \"American shot\" was its frequent use in the western genre. This was because a shot that started at knee level would reveal the weapon of a cowboy, usually holstered at their waist. It is actually the closest the camera can get to an actor while keeping both their face and their holstered gun in frame.\n\nThe French critics thought it was characteristic of American films of the 1930s or 1940s; however, it was mostly characteristic of cheaper American movies, such as Charlie Chan mysteries where people collected in front of a fireplace or at the foot of the stairs in order to explain what happened a few minutes ago.\n\nHoward Hawks legitimized this style in his films, allowing characters to act, even when not talking, when most of the audience would not be paying attention. It became his trademark style.\n\nReferences \n\nCinematography",
    "Arecales is an order of flowering plants. The order has been widely recognised only for the past few decades; until then, the accepted name for the order including these plants was Principes.\n\nTaxonomy\nThe APG IV system of 2016 places Dasypogonaceae in this order, after studies showing Dasypogonaceae as sister to Arecaceae. However, this decision has been called into question.\n\nHistorical taxonomical systems \nThe Cronquist system of 1981 assigned the order to the subclass Arecidae in the class Liliopsida (= monocotyledons).\n\nThe Thorne system (1992) and the Dahlgren system assigned the order to the superorder Areciflorae, also called Arecanae in the subclass Liliidae (= monocotyledons), with the single family Arecaceae.\n\nThe APG II system of 2003 recognised the order and placed it in the clade commelinids in the monocots and uses this circumscription:\n\n order Arecales\n family Arecaceae, alternative name Palmae\n\nThis was unchanged from the APG system of 1998, although it used the spelling \"commelinoids\" instead of commelinids.\n\nPrincipes \nIn plant taxonomy, Principes is a botanical name, meaning \"the first\". It was used in the Engler system for an order in the Monocotyledones and later in the Kubitzki system. This order included one family only, the Palmae (alternate name Arecaceae). As the rules for botanical nomenclature provide for the use of such descriptive botanical names above the rank of family it is quite allowed to use this name even today, but in practice most systems prefer the name Arecales.\n\nFollowing this, Principes became the name of the journal of the International Palm Society, becoming Palms in 1999.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n NCBI Taxonomy Browser\n\n \nAngiosperm orders\nLate Cretaceous plants\nExtant Campanian first appearances\n\nes:Arecales",

It is one of the defining books in the early formative years of modern baseball.\n\nMuch of the story is told first-hand; since the 1850s, Spalding had been involved in the game, first as a pitcher and later a manager and club owner. Later he branched out to become a leading manufacturer of sporting goods.\n\nIn addition to his personal recollections, he had access to the records of Henry Chadwick, the game's first statistician and archivist.

    "Dasyproctidae is a family of large South American rodents, comprising the agoutis and acouchis. Their fur is a reddish or dark colour above, with a paler underside. They are herbivorous, often feeding on ripe fruit that falls from trees. They live in burrows, and, like squirrels, will bury some of their food for later use.\n\nDasyproctids exist in Central and South America, which are the tropical parts of the New World. The fossil record of this family can be traced back to the Late Oligocene (Deseadan in the SALMA classification).\n\nAs with all rodents, members of this family have incisors, pre-molars, and molars, but no canines.

    "Aimoin of Fleury (; ), French chronicler, was born at Villefranche-de-Longchat, Southwestern France about 960. Early in his life he entered the monastery of Fleury, where he became a monk and then passed the greater part of his life. Between c. 980 and 985 Aimoin wrote about St. Benedict in Abbey of Fleury-sur-Loire.  His chief work is a Historia Francorum, or Libri V. de Gestis Francorum, which deals with the history of the Franks from the earliest times to 653, and was continued by other writers until the middle of the twelfth century. It was much in vogue during the Middle Ages, but its historical value is now regarded as slight. It was edited by G. Waitz and published in the Monumenta Germaniae Historica: Scriptores, Band xxvi (Hanover and Berlin, 1826\u20131892).\n\nIn 1004 he also wrote Vita Abbonis, abbatis Floriacensis, the last of a series of lives of the abbots of Fleury, all of which, except the life of Abbo, have been lost.  This was published by J. Mabillon in the Acta sanctorum ordinis sancti Benedicti (Paris, 1668\u20131701).\n\nAimoin's third work was the composition of books ii and iii of the Miracula sancti Benedicti, the first book of which was written by another monk of Fleury named Adrevald ( - 878).

He was, however, dispossessed of both Macedon and Epirus by Demetrius II of Macedon, the son of Antigonus II; upon which he took refuge amongst the Acarnanians. By their assistance and that of his own subjects, who entertained a great attachment for him, he recovered Epirus. It appears that he was in alliance with the Aetolians. \n\nAlexander married his paternal half-sister Olympias, by whom he had two sons, Pyrrhus \u0399\u0399, Ptolemy \u0399\u0399 and a daughter, Phthia. Beloch places the death of King\u00a0Alexander II\u00a0\"about\u00a0255\", and supports this date with an elaborate chain of reasoning. On the death of Alexander, Olympias assumed the regency on behalf of her sons, and married Phthia to Demetrius.  There are extant silver and copper coins of this king.

He spent some time, together with Antagoras and Aratus, at the court of Antigonus II Gonatas.\n\nNotwithstanding the distinction Alexander enjoyed as a tragic poet, he appears to have had greater merit as a writer of epic poems, elegies, epigrams, and cynaedi.

    "The Alexandrists were a school of Renaissance philosophers who, in the great controversy on the subject of personal immortality, adopted the explanation of the De Anima given by Alexander of Aphrodisias.\n\nAccording to the orthodox Thomism of the Catholic Church, Aristotle rightly regarded reason as a facility of the individual soul. Against this, the Averroists, led by Agostino Nifo, introduced the modifying theory that universal reason in a sense individualizes itself in each soul and then absorbs the active reason into itself again.  These two theories respectively evolved the doctrine of individual and universal immortality, or the absorption of the individual into the eternal One.\n\nThe Alexandrists, led by Pietro Pomponazzi, assailed these beliefs and denied that either was rightly attributed to Aristotle.  They held that Aristotle considered the soul as a material and therefore a mortal entity which operates during life only under the authority of universal reason.  Hence the Alexandrists denied that Aristotle viewed the soul as immortal, because in their view, since they believed that Aristotle viewed the soul as organically connected with the body, the dissolution of the latter involves the extinction of the former.\n\nReferences \n\nAttribution:\n \n\nChristian philosophers",
    "\u201cHymn to Proserpine\u201d is a poem by Algernon Charles Swinburne, published in Poems and Ballads in 1866.  The poem is addressed to the goddess Proserpina, the Roman equivalent of Persephone, but laments the rise of Christianity for displacing the pagan goddess and her pantheon.\n\nThe epigraph at the beginning of the poem is the phrase Vicisti, Galilaee, Latin for \"You have conquered, O Galilean\", the supposed dying words of the Emperor Julian.  He had tried to reverse the official endorsement of Christianity by the Roman Empire.  The poem is cast in the form of a lament by a person professing the paganism of classical antiquity and lamenting its passing, and expresses regret at the rise of Christianity.\n\nThe line \"Time and the Gods are at strife\" inspired the title of Lord Dunsany's Time and the Gods.\n\nThe poem is quoted by Sue Bridehead in Thomas Hardy's 1895 novel, Jude the Obscure and also by Edward Ashburnham in Ford Madox Ford's The Good Soldier.\n\nSee also\n \u201cThe Garden of Proserpine\u201d, another poem by A.

    "\"The Triumph of Time\" is a poem by Algernon Charles Swinburne, published in Poems and Ballads in 1866. It is in adapted ottava rima and is full of elaborate use of literary devices, particularly alliteration. The theme, which purports to be autobiographical, is that of rejected love. The speaker deplores the ruin of his life, and in tones at times reminiscent of Hamlet, craves oblivion, for which the sea serves as a constant metaphor.\n\nSee also\nPoems and Ballads\n\nNotes\n\nExternal links\n\nComplete text of the poem\nVictorian Web article on the poem\n\nBritish poems\n1866 poems\nPoetry by Algernon Charles Swinburne",

    "Alypius of Antioch was a geographer and a vicarius of Roman Britain, probably in the late 350s AD. He replaced Flavius Martinus after that vicarius' suicide. His rule is recorded is Ammianus XXIII 1, 3.\n\nLife\nHe came from Antioch and served under Constantius II and was probably appointed to ensure that nobody with western associations was serving in Britain during a time of mistrust, rebellion and suppression symbolised by the brutal acts of the imperial notary Paulus Catena. He may have had to deal with the insurrection of the usurper named Carausius II.\n\nAlypius was afterwards commissioned to rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem as part of Julian's systematic attempt to reverse the Christianization of the Roman Empire by restoring pagan and, in this case, Jewish practices. Among the letters of Julian are two (29 and 30) addressed to Alypius; one inviting him to Rome, the other thanking him for a geographical treatise, which no longer exists.\n\nReferences\n\nSources\nTodd, M., Roman Britain, Fontana, London 1985\nSalway, P., Roman Britain, Oxford, 1986\n\nJews and Judaism in the Roman Empire\nAncient Romans in Britain\nPeople from Antioch\nAncient Roman geographers\nRoman governors of Britain\n4th-century Romans\nLate-Roman-era pagans\n4th-century geographers",

    "Amarasimha (IAST: , ) was a Sanskrit grammarian and poet from ancient India, of whose personal history hardly anything is known. He is said to have been \"one of the nine gems that adorned the throne of Vikramaditya,\" and according to the evidence of Xuanzang, this is the Chandragupta Vikramaditya (Chandragupta II) who flourished about CE 375. Other sources describe him as belonging to the period of Vikramaditya of 7th century. Most of Amarasi\u1e43ha's works were lost, with the exception of the celebrated Amara-Kosha (IAST: ) (Treasury of Amara). The first reliable mention of the Amarakosha is in the Amoghavritti of Shakatayana composed during the reign of Amoghavarsha (814-867 CE)\n\nThe Amarakosha is a lexicon of Sanskrit words in three books, and hence is sometimes called the Trik\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d\u012b or the \"Tripartite\". It is also known as \"Namalinganushasana\". The Amarakosha contains 10,000 words, and is arranged, like other works of its class, in metre, to aid the memory.\n\nThe first chapter of the Kosha was printed at Rome in Tamil character in 1798. An edition of the entire work, with English notes and an index by Henry Thomas Colebrooke appeared at Serampore in 1808. The Sanskrit text was printed at Calcutta in 1831. A French translation by ALA Loiseleur-Deslongchamps was published at Paris in 1839. B. L.

    "August Wilhelm Ambros (17 November 181628 June 1876) was an Austrian composer and music historian of Czech descent.\n\nLife \nHe was born in M\u00fdto, Rokycany District, Bohemia. His father was a cultured man, and his mother was the sister of Raphael Georg Kiesewetter (1773\u20131850), the musical archaeologist and collector. Ambros studied at the University of Prague and was well-educated in music and the arts, which were his abiding passion. He was, however, destined for the law and an official career in the Austrian civil service, and from 1839 he occupied various important posts under the ministry of justice, music being an avocation.\n\nFrom 1850 onwards, he became well known as a critic and essay-writer, and in 1860 he began working on his magnum opus, his History of Music, which was published at intervals from 1862 in five volumes, the last two (1878, 1882) being edited and completed by Otto Kade and Wilhelm Langhans.\n\nAmbros was a professor of the history of music at Prague from 1869 to 1871. Also in Prague, he sat on the board of governors in the Prague Royal Conservatory. By 1872, he was living in Vienna and was employed by the Department of Justice as an officer and by Prince Rudolf's family as his tutor. Through his work in Vienna, he was given a leave of absence for half the year in order to let him travel the world to collect musical information to include in his History of Music book. He was an excellent pianist, and the author of numerous compositions reminiscent of Felix Mendelssohn.\n\nAmbros died at Vienna, Austria at the age of 59.\n\nNotes\n\n1816 births\n1876 deaths\nPeople from M\u00fdto\n19th-century Austrian musicians\n19th-century Austrian male musicians\n19th-century classical composers\n19th-century Czech musicians\nAustrian classical composers\nAustrian male classical composers\nAustrian people of German Bohemian descent\nCharles University alumni\nCzech male classical composers\nGerman Bohemian people\nCzech Romantic composers\nJosquin scholars\n19th-century musicologists",
    "Ancyra is a small genus of planthoppers of the family Eurybrachidae and the only genus in the tribe Ancyrini. Species in this genus occur in southeast Asia.\n\nDescription\nMembers of the genus are well known for having a pair of prolonged filaments at the tips of the forewings that arise near a pair of small glossy spots; this creates the impression of a pair of antennae, with corresponding \"eyes\" (a remarkable case of automimicry). The \"false head\" effect is further reinforced by the bugs' habit of walking backwards when it detects movement nearby, so as to misdirect predators to strike at its rear, rather than at its actual head.\n\nTaxonomy\nThe genus Ancyra was first named in 1845 by Scottish zoologist Adam White. It is the only genus of the tribe Ancyrini (subfamily Platybrachinae, family Eurybrachidae). The type species is Ancyra appendiculata, the species name meaning bearing appendages.\n\nSpecies\n, lists the following seven species in the genus Ancyra:\n\nAncyra annamensis  \u2013 Vietnam\nAncyra appendiculata  \u2013 Myanmar\nAncyra histrionica  \u2013 Cambodia, Myanmar\nAncyra luangana \nAncyra nigrifrons  \u2013 Malaysia\nAncyra vicina  \u2013 Vietnam\nAncyra xiengana\n\nReferences\n\nFauna of Southeast Asia\nEurybrachidae\nAuchenorrhyncha genera",

It is usually assumed that he came from the Cyrrhus in Macedonia rather than the one in Syria.\n\nWork\nAndronicus is usually credited with the construction of the Tower of the Winds in the Roman forum at Athens around  a considerable portion of which still exists. It is octagonal, with figures of the eight principal winds (Anemoi) carved on the appropriate side. Originally, a bronze figure of Triton was placed on the summit that was turned round by the wind so that the rod in his hand pointed to the correct wind direction, an idea replicated with subsequent wind vanes. The interior housed a large clepsydra and the exterior housed multiple sundials so that it functioned as a kind of early clocktower.\n\nHe also built a multifaced sundial for the Temple of Poseidon on the island of Tinos.\n\nReferences\n\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n \n .\n\nExternal links\nTenos island - Epigraphical Database - IG XII,5 891\n\nAncient Greek astronomers\nAncient Macedonian scientists\nAncient Macedonians in Athens\nRoman-era Macedonians\n2nd-century BC births\n1st-century BC deaths\nYear of birth unknown\nYear of death unknown\n2nd-century BC astronomers",
    "Andronicoos of Rhodes (; ; ) was a Greek philosopher from Rhodes who was also the scholarch (head) of the Peripatetic school. He is most famous for publishing a new edition of the works of Aristotle that forms the basis of the texts that survive today.\n\nLife\nLittle is known about Andronicus' life. He is reported to have been the eleventh scholarch of the Peripatetic school. He taught in Rome, about 58\u00a0BC, and was the teacher of Boethus of Sidon, with whom Strabo studied.\n\nWorks of Aristotle\nAndronicus is of special interest in the history of philosophy, from the statement of Plutarch, that he published a new edition of the works of Aristotle and Theophrastus, which formerly belonged to the library of Apellicon, and were brought to Rome by Sulla with the rest of Apellicon's library in 84. Tyrannion commenced this task, but apparently did not do much towards it. The arrangement which Andronicus made of Aristotle's writings seems to be the one which forms the basis of our present editions and we are probably indebted to him for the preservation of a large number of Aristotle's works.\n\nWritings\nAndronicus wrote a work upon Aristotle, the fifth book of which contained a complete list of the philosopher's writings, and he also wrote commentaries upon the Physics, Ethics, and Categories.  None of these works is extant.  Two treatises are sometimes erroneously attributed to him, one On Emotions, the other a commentary on Aristotle's Ethics (really by Constantine Paleocappa in the 16th century, or by John Callistus of Thessalonica).\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\n The Rediscovery of the Corpus Aristotelicum with an annotated bibliography\n\nAttribution\n\n1st-century BC Greek philosophers\nCommentators on Aristotle\nRoman-era Peripatetic philosophers\nRoman-era philosophers in Rome\nPhilosophers in ancient Rhodes\nRoman-era Rhodians\nAncient Greek ethicists",

    "In organic chemistry, hydrocarbons (compounds composed solely of carbon and hydrogen) are divided into two classes: aromatic compounds and aliphatic compounds (; G. aleiphar, fat, oil). Aliphatic compounds can be saturated (in which all the C-C bonds are single requiring the structure to be completed, or 'saturated', by hydrogen) like hexane, or unsaturated, like hexene and hexyne. Open-chain compounds, whether straight or branched, and which contain no rings of any type, are always aliphatic. Cyclic compounds can be aliphatic if they are not aromatic.\n\nStructure \n\nAliphatic compounds can be saturated, joined by single bonds (alkanes), or unsaturated, with double bonds (alkenes) or triple bonds (alkynes). If other elements (heteroatoms) are bound to the carbon chain, the most common being oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and chlorine, it is no longer a hydrocarbon, and therefore no longer an aliphatic compound. However, such compounds may still be referred to as aliphatic if the hydrocarbon portion of the molecule is aliphatic, e.g. aliphatic amines, to differentiate them from aromatic amines.\n\nThe least complex aliphatic compound is methane (CH4).\n\nProperties \n\nMost aliphatic compounds are flammable, allowing the use of hydrocarbons as fuel, such as methane in natural gas for stoves or heating; butane in torches and lighters; various aliphatic (as well as aromatic) hydrocarbons in liquid transportation fuels like petrol/gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel; and other uses such as ethyne (acetylene) in welding.\n\nExamples of aliphatic compounds \nThe most important aliphatic compounds are:\n\n n-, iso- and cyclo-alkanes (saturated hydrocarbons)\n n-, iso- and cyclo-alkenes and -alkynes (unsaturated hydrocarbons).\n\nImportant examples of low-molecular aliphatic compounds can be found in the list below (sorted by the number of carbon-atoms):\n\nReferences\n\nOrganic compounds",

    "Aedesius (, died 355 AD) was a Neoplatonist philosopher and mystic. He was born into a wealthy Cappadocian family, but he moved to Syria, where he was apprenticed to Iamblichos. None of his writings have survived, but there is an extant biography by Eunapius, a Greek sophist and historian of the 4th century who wrote a collection of biographies titled Lives of the Sophists. Aedesius's philosophical doctrine was a mixture between Platonism and eclecticism and, according to Eunapius, he differed from Iamblichus on certain points connected with theurgy and magic. \n\nThe school of Syria was dispersed after Iamblichus' death, and Aedesius seems to have modified his doctrines out of fear of Constantine II, and took refuge in divination. An oracle in hexameter verse represented a pastoral life as his only retreat, but his disciples, perhaps calming his fears by a metaphorical interpretation, compelled him to resume his instructions. Aedesius then founded a school of philosophy at Pergamon, which emphasized theurgy and the revival of polytheism, and where he numbered among his pupils Eusebius of Myndus, Maximus of Ephesus, and the Roman emperor Julian. After the accession of the latter to the imperial purple he invited Aedesius to continue his instructions, but the declining strength of the sage being unequal to the task, two of his most learned disciples, Chrysanthius and the aforementioned Eusebius, were by his own desire appointed to supply his place. His co-teacher and perhaps consort at the Pergamon school was the female philosopher and mystic, Sosipatra.\n\nReferences\n\n355 deaths\n4th-century Romans\n4th-century Greek philosophers\nNeoplatonists\nYear of birth missing",

For example, if James's will states that he is leaving his $500,000 yacht to his brother Mike, the yacht would be a specific devise.\n\nA general devise, is a monetary gift to a specific person to be satisfied out of the overall estate. For example, if James's will states that he is leaving $500,000 to his son Sam then the money would be a general devise.\n\nA demonstrative devise, is money given from a particular account. For example, \"$10,000 to be paid from the sale of my GM stock.\"\n\nA residual devise is one left to a devisee after all specific and general devices have been made. For example, James's will might say: \"I give all the rest, residue and remainder of my estate to my daughter Lilly.\" Lilly would be the residual devisee and entitled to James's residuary estate.\n\nReferences\n\nCommon law\nWills and trusts",

    " \n\nAbdera was an ancient Carthaginian and Roman port on a hill above the modern Adra on the southeastern Mediterranean coast of Spain. It was located between Malaca (now M\u00e1laga) and Carthago Nova (now Cartagena) in the district inhabited by the Bastuli.\n\nName\nAbdera shares its name with a city in Thrace and another in North Africa. Its coins bore the inscription  (). The first element in the name appears to be the Punic word for \"servant\" or \"slave\"; the second element seems shared by the Phoenician names for Gadir (now Cadiz) and Cythera but of unclear meaning.\n\nIt appears in Greek sources as t\u00e0 \u00c1bd\u0113ra () and A\u00fad\u0113ra (), \u00c1bdara (), and t\u00f2 \u00c1bd\u0113ron ().\n\nHistory\nAbdera was founded in the 8th century BCE as a Phoenician colony. It became a Carthaginian trading station and, after a period of decline, became one of the more important towns in the Roman province of Hispania Baetica. Tiberius seems to have made the place a Roman colony.\n\nCoins\nThe most ancient coins bear its name with the head of Melqart and a tuna. Coins from the time of Tiberius show the town's main temple with two erect tunas as its columns. Early Roman coins were bilingual with Latin inscriptions on one side stating the name of the emperor and the town and with Punic text on the other side simply stating the name of the town.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n .\n\nFurther reading\n \n\nPhoenician colonies in Spain\nFormer populated places in Spain\nArchaeological sites in Andalusia\nRoman sites in Spain",
    "An anti-diarrhoeal drug (or anti-diarrheal drug in American English) is any medication which provides symptomatic relief for diarrhoea.\n\nTypes\n Electrolyte solutions, while not true antidiarrhoeals, are used to replace lost fluids and salts in acute cases.\n Bulking agents like methylcellulose, guar gum or plant fibre (bran, sterculia, isabgol, etc.) are used for diarrhoea in functional bowel disease and to control ileostomy output.\n Absorbents absorb toxic substances that cause infective diarrhoea, methylcellulose is an absorbent.\n Anti-inflammatory compounds such as bismuth subsalicylate.\n Anticholinergics reduce intestinal movement and are effective against both diarrhoea and accompanying cramping. \n Opioids' classical use besides pain relief is as an anti-diarrhoeal drug. Opioids have agonist actions on the intestinal opioid receptors, which when activated cause constipation. Drugs such as morphine or codeine can be used to relieve diarrhoea this way. A notable opioid for the purpose of relief of diarrhoea is loperamide which is only an agonist of the \u03bc opioid receptors in the large intestine and does not have opioid affects in the central nervous system as it doesn't cross the blood\u2013brain barrier in significant amounts. This enables loperamide to be used to the same benefit as other opioid drugs but without the CNS side effects or potential for abuse.\nOctreotide (somatostatin analogue) may be used in hospitalized patients to treat secretory diarrhea.\n\nSee also\n ATC code A07 Antidiarrheals, intestinal anti-inflammatory/anti-infective agents\n\nReferences",
    "The Abencerrages or Abencerrajes (from the Arabic for \"Saddler's Son\") were a family or faction that is said to have held a prominent position in the Kingdom of Granada in the 15th century.\n\nThe name appears to have been derived from Yussuf ben-Serragh, the head of the tribe in the time of Muhammed VII, Sultan of Granada (1370\u20131408), who did that sovereign good service in his struggles to retain the crown of which he was three times deprived.\n\nLittle is known of the family with certainty. The Chambers Biographical Dictionary records that they arrived in Spain in the 8th century but the name is familiar from the romance by Gin\u00e9s P\u00e9rez de Hita, Guerras civiles de Granada, which celebrates the feuds of the Abencerrages and the rival family of the Benedin (Arabic banu Edin), and the cruel treatment to which the former were subjected. J. P. de Florian's Gonsalve de Cordoue and Chateaubriand's Le dernier des Abencerrages are adaptations of P\u00e9rez de Hita's story.\n\nThe story is told that one of the Abencerrages, having fallen in love with a lady of the royal family, was caught in the act of climbing up to her window. The assassinations were ordered by Ibrahim Benedin, who had a feud with the family. He was enraged and shut up the whole family in one of the halls of the Alhambra, and gave orders to kill them all. The apartment where this is said to have taken place is one of the most beautiful courts of the Alhambra, and is still called the Hall of the Abencerrages.\n\nWashington Irving in Tales of the Alhambra (1832) disagrees, saying the massacre was a fiction, but that a number of Abencerrages were killed in one of the battles at the time.  Nonetheless, many poems and plays, the novella The Abencerraje and two operas (Les Abenc\u00e9rages, by Luigi Cherubini, and L'esule di Granata, by Giacomo Meyerbeer) mention the legend.\n\nNotes\n\nExternal links \n\nThe Abencerrages\u2013Part 17 of Washington Irving's Tales of the Alhambra\n\nNasrid dynasty",

    "Abhorrers, the name given in 1679 to the persons who expressed their abhorrence at the action of those who had signed petitions urging King Charles II of England to assemble Parliament.\n\nFeeling against Catholics, and especially against James, Duke of York, was running strongly; the Exclusion Bill had been passed by the House of Commons, and the popularity of James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth, was very great.\n\nTo prevent this bill from passing into law, Charles had dissolved the parliament in July 1679, and in the following October had prorogued its successor, which became known as the Exclusion Bill Parliament, without allowing it to meet.  He was then deluged with petitions urging him to call it together. This agitation was opposed by Sir George Jeffreys and Francis Wythens, who presented addresses expressing abhorrence of the Petitioners, and thus initiated the movement of the abhorrers, who supported the action of the king. \"The frolic went all over England,\" says Roger North; and the addresses of the Abhorrers which reached the king from all parts of the country formed a counterblast to those of the Petitioners.

    "Belgian hip hop music has a few rappers stemming from Africa and Italy. Belgium, like France, controlled African countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire), Rwanda, and Burundi until the early 1960s. Like in France, immigrants from these countries started to study and live in Belgium.\n\nThe Belgian hip hop scene started in the late 1980s with a U.S.-based techno/hip hop group called Technotronic. In the group was an emcee named Ya Kid K from the Democratic Republic of the Congo who later led the group into international fame with hits like \"Pump up the Jam\" and \"Shake That Body\". In 1990, she also joined the group Hi-Tek 3 who were heard on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack.\n\nHowever, the first major pop rapper from Belgium was Benny B, who had a very mainstream and commercial sound.  According to the European Music Office's report on Music in Europe, this was the first of many pop acts that helped inspire a backlash and the creation of an underground hip hop scene.\n\nAlso in the late 1980s in the Walloon south of the country, French speaking/rapping Starflam was the biggest name in hip hop. In the Flemish north Dutch speaking/rapping groups like 't Hof van Commerce, Krapoel In Axe, St Andries MC's, and ABN were popular, rapping in their regional dialects.\n\nToday, the Belgian hip hop scene is growing. Rappers like Coely, Rom\u00e9o Elvis and Damso are achieving commercial success in their country and abroad. Other contemporary rappers/formations are Stikstof, Woodie Smalls, L'Or Du Commun and Isha.\n\nTo find out more about today's Belgian hip hop scene, check out The Belgian Hip Hop Channel.\n\nReferences",

    "Ambrose of Alexandria (before 212 \u2013 c. 250) was a friend of the Christian theologian Origen. Ambrose was attracted by Origen's fame as a teacher, and visited the Catechetical School of Alexandria in 212.  At first a gnostic Valentinian and Marcionist, Ambrose, through Origen's teaching, eventually rejected this theology and became Origen's constant companion, and was ordained deacon. He plied Origen with questions, and urged him to write his Commentaries (treating him as \"\" in Commentary on John V,1) on the books of the Bible, and, as a wealthy nobleman and courtier, he provided his teacher with books for his studies and secretaries to lighten the labor of composition.\n\nHe suffered during the persecution under the Roman emperor Maximinus Thrax in 235. He was later released and died a confessor. The last mention of Ambrose in the historical record is in Origen's Contra Celsum, which the latter wrote at the solicitation of Ambrose.\n\nOrigen often speaks of Ambrose affectionately as a man of education with excellent literary and scholarly tastes. All of Origen's works written after 218 are dedicated to Ambrose, including his On Martyrdom, Contra Celsum, Commentary on St. John's Gospel, and On Prayer.

After the suppression of the revolt and the destruction of the temple, Ammonius fled to Constantinople, where he became the tutor of the ecclesiastical historian Socrates.\n\nAmmonius was formerly identified as the  author of a treatise titled Peri homo\u00ed\u014dn kai diaph\u00f3r\u014dn l\u00e9xe\u014dn (\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u1f41\u03bc\u03bf\u03af\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c6\u03cc\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd \u03bb\u03ad\u03be\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd, On the Differences of Synonymous Expressions).

    "In card games, a burn card is a playing card dealt from the top of a deck, and discarded (\"burned\"), unused by the players. Burn cards are usually not shown to the players.\n\nBurning is most often performed in casinos to deter a form of cheating known as card marking. In poker, for example, the top card of the deck stub is burned at the beginning of each betting round, so that players who might have been able to read markings on that card during the previous round are less able to take advantage of that information. Knowledge of a burn card might be marginally useful, such as knowing there is one fewer Ace in the deck, but far less so than knowing it is about to be in play.\n\nTwo other uses for burning are: to prevent second dealing and to provide extra cards for use when an irregularity of play occurs.  Sometimes a misdealt card (such as one of the down cards in poker that has flashed during the deal) will be used as the burn card \u2013 in those cases, the card should be immediately placed face up on the deck after the deal is complete.\n\nWhen Texas hold 'em (as well as in Omaha hold 'em) is played in casinos (or other formal games where cheating is a concern), a card is burned before dealing the flop, turn, and river, for a maximum of 3 total burn cards.\n\nReferences \n\nPoker gameplay and terminology",

    "The String Quartet No. 16 in F major, Op. 135, by Ludwig van Beethoven  was written in October 1826 and was the last major work he completed. Only the final movement of the Quartet Op. 130,  written as a replacement for the Gro\u00dfe Fuge, was composed later. The work was premiered by the Schuppanzigh Quartet in March 1828, one year after Beethoven's death.\n\nThe Op. 135 quartet is the shortest of Beethoven's late quartets. Under the introductory slow chords in the last movement, which is headed \"Der schwer gefa\u00dfte Entschlu\u00df\" (The Difficult Decision), Beethoven wrote in the manuscript \"Mu\u00df es sein?\" (Must it be?) to which he responds, with the faster main theme of the movement, \"Es mu\u00df sein!\" (It must be!). \n\nIt is in four movements:\n\n Allegretto (F major)\n Vivace (F major)\n Lento assai, cantante e tranquillo (D major)\n \"Der schwer gefa\u00dfte Entschlu\u00df\".

The work is commonly known as the Spring Sonata (Fr\u00fchlingssonate), although the name \"Spring\" was apparently given to it after Beethoven's death.  The sonata was dedicated to Count Moritz von Fries, a patron to whom Beethoven also dedicated two other works of the same year\u2014the String Quintet in C major, Op. 29 and the Violin Sonata No. 4\u2014as well as his later Symphony No. 7 in A major.\n\nThe autograph manuscript of the sonata is preserved in the Austrian National Library.\n\nOrigin\nBeethoven initially intended to pair this work with his Violin Sonata No. 4, Opus 23, and the two sonatas complement each other in both key and character.  However, the two were not published together and thus have different opus numbers.

    "In baseball statistics, total bases (TB) is the number of bases a player has gained with hits. It is a weighted sum for which the weight value is 1 for a single, 2 for a double, 3 for a triple and 4 for a home run. Only bases attained from hits count toward this total. Reaching base by other means (such as a base on balls) or advancing further after the hit (such as when a subsequent batter gets a hit) does not increase the player's total bases.\n\nThe total bases divided by the number of at bats is the player's slugging average.\n\nHank Aaron is the career leader in total bases with 6,856.

For example, from the statements \"if I'm breathing, then I'm alive\" and \"if I'm alive, then I'm breathing\", it can be inferred that \"I'm breathing if and only if I'm alive\".

It was first proposed by South African Prime Minister J. B. M. Hertzog and Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King.\n\nThe declaration accepted the growing political and diplomatic independence of the Dominions in the years after World War I. It also recommended that the governors-general, the representatives of the King in each dominion, should no longer also serve automatically as the representative of the British government in diplomatic relations between the countries. In following years, high commissioners were gradually appointed, whose duties were soon recognised to be virtually identical to those of an ambassador. The first such British high commissioner was appointed to Canada in 1928.\n\nThe conclusions of the Imperial Conference of 1926 were re-stated by the 1930 conference and incorporated in the Statute of Westminster of December 1931. In the statute, the British Parliament provided that it would not enact a law which applied to a Dominion as part of the law of that Dominion, unless the law expressly stated that the Dominion government had requested and consented to the enactment of that law.\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\nTranscript of the Declaration\n\nBritish Empire\nHistory of the Commonwealth of Nations\nCommonwealth realms\nMonarchy in the Irish Free State\nLegal history of Canada\n1926 in London\n1926 in international relations\nProclamations\n1926 in the British Empire\n1926 documents\nNovember 1926 events\nArthur Balfour",

    "Ballu tundu or ballu sardu is a traditional Sardinian folk dance which is typically danced in a closed or open circle. The dance was described as early as 1805 by Mameli and by La Marmora in 1825. In northern and central Sardinia, the dance is lively and animated with leaps and agile movements and usually accompanied by a choir of three or more singers in the center of the circle. In other areas, the dance is done to launeddas and the shepherd's sulittu but the accordion had also made its appearance by the 19th century. The Introduction is in  time but the dance itself is done in .\n\nAt least in the past, the manner of holding hands was very important and followed strict rules. Married or engaged couples could hold hands palm to palm with fingers entwined, but a man could not do this with a young girl or another man's wife. If a stranger entered the circle, he had to do so to the woman's right so as not to come between her and her husband.\n\nReferences\n\nItalian folk dances\nMusic in Sardinia",

    "The critical philosophy () movement, attributed to Immanuel Kant (1724\u20131804), sees the primary task of philosophy as criticism rather than justification of knowledge. Criticism, for Kant, meant judging as to the possibilities of knowledge before advancing to knowledge itself (from the Greek kritike (techne), or \"art of judgment\"). The basic task of philosophers, according to this view, is not to establish and demonstrate theories about reality, but rather to subject all theories\u2014including those about philosophy itself\u2014to critical review, and measure their validity by how well they withstand criticism.\n\n\"Critical philosophy\" is also used as another name for Kant's philosophy itself. Kant said that philosophy's proper inquiry is not about what is out there in reality, but rather about the character and foundations of experience itself. We must first judge how human reason works, and within what limits, so that we can afterwards correctly apply it to sense experience and determine whether it can be applied at all to metaphysical objects.\n\nThe principal three sources on which the critical philosophy is based are the three critiques, namely Critique of Pure Reason, Critique of Practical Reason and Critique of Judgement, published between 1781 and 1790 and mostly concerned, respectively, with metaphysics, ethics and aesthetics.\n\nSee also \nCritical idealism\nCritical thinking\nCharles Bernard Renouvier\nL\u00e9on Brunschvicg\n\nReferences\n Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Immanuel Kant\n\nKantianism",
    "Commelinales is an order of flowering plants. It comprises five families: Commelinaceae, Haemodoraceae, Hanguanaceae, Philydraceae, and Pontederiaceae. All the families combined contain over 885 species in about 70 genera; the majority of species are in the Commelinaceae. Plants in the order share a number of synapomorphies that tie them together, such as a lack of mycorrhizal associations and tapetal raphides. Estimates differ as to when the Commelinales evolved, but most suggest an origin and diversification sometime during the mid- to late Cretaceous. Depending on the methods used, studies suggest a range of origin between 123 and 73 million years, with diversification occurring within the group 110 to 66 million years ago. The order's closest relatives are in the Zingiberales, which includes ginger, bananas, cardamom, and others.\n\nTaxonomy\nAccording to the most recent classification scheme, the APG IV of 2016, the order includes five families:\n Commelinaceae\n Haemodoraceae\n Hanguanaceae\n Philydraceae\n Pontederiaceae\n\nThis is unchanged from the APG III of 2009 and the APG II of 2003, but different from the older APG system of 1998, which did not include Hanguanaceae.\n\nPrevious classification systems \nThe older Cronquist system of 1981, which was based purely on morphological data, placed the order in subclass Commelinidae of class Liliopsida and included the families Commelinaceae, Mayacaceae, Rapateaceae and Xyridaceae.

    "The politics of the Cayman Islands takes place within a framework of parliamentary democracy, within the confines of the Government of the Cayman Islands.\n\nConstitutional Modernisation\nConstitutional Modernisation has come to the forefront of politics recently with the collapse of the now defunct Euro Bank Corporation in 2003. The prosecution in the trial was forced to reveal that the British Government had planted moles (and used wire taps) throughout the banking industry using MI6, with the consent of the Governor. This caused the trial's collapse, and subsequent release of those charged with wrongdoing. Along with this, the only mole that was known at the time was allowed to leave the country, never to answer for what he (or the United Kingdom) was doing. This infuriated the elected members of the Legislative Assembly as they maintained that the Governor and the United Kingdom had put into question the Cayman Islands' reputation as a tightly regulated offshore jurisdiction. Some saw this as the United Kingdom meddling in the territory's affairs to benefit itself (and the EU), at the expense of the islands' economy. \n\nConstitutional talks however went on hold following Hurricane Ivan in 2004. Subsequently, in May 2005 the ruling UDP was ousted by the PPM, which restarted the process of constitutional modernisation.

    "The foreign relations of the Cayman Islands are largely managed from the United Kingdom, as the islands remains one of 14 overseas territories under British jurisdiction and sovereignty. However, the Government of the Cayman Islands have autonomy and often resolves important issues with foreign governments alone, without intervention from Britain. Although in its early days, the Cayman Islands' most important relationships were with Britain and Jamaica, in recent years, this has shifted, and they now rely more so on the United States and Canada.\n\nThough the Cayman Islands are involved in no major international disputes, they have come under some criticism due to the use of their territory for narcotics trafficking and money laundering. In an attempt to address this, the Government entered into the Narcotics Agreement of 1984 and the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty of 1986 with the United States, in order to reduce the use of their facilities associated with these activities. In more recent years, they have stepped up the fight against money laundering, by limiting banking secrecy, introducing requirements for customer identification and record keeping, and requiring banks to cooperate with foreign investigators.\n\nDue to their status as an overseas territory of the UK, the Cayman Islands have no representation either on the United Nations, or in most other international organizations. However, the Cayman Islands still participates in some international organisations, being a full member of the Central Development Bank and International Olympic Committee, an associate member of Caricom and UNESCO, and a member of a subbureau of Interpol.\n\nBilateral relations\n\nIndia\n\nUnited States\n\nReferences\n\nSee also\nForeign relations of the United Kingdom\nBritish Overseas Territories\n\nGovernment of the Cayman Islands\nForeign relations of the Caribbean",

    "The Claudine series consists of four early novels by French authors Colette and Henry Gauthier-Villars, published 1900\u20131904. Written in diary form, they describe the growth to maturity of a young girl, Claudine. Aged fifteen at the beginning of the first book, Claudine at School, the series describes her education and experiences as she grows up. All the books are written in first-person with the first three having Claudine herself as the narrator.  The last in the series, Claudine s'en va, introduces a new narrator, Annie.\n\nThe novels were written in the late 19th century in collaboration with Colette's first husband, the writer Henry Gauthier-Villars, better known by his pen name \"Willy\". There has been much speculation over the degree of involvement of both Colette and Willy in the writing of the Claudine novels, particularly as Willy was known for often using ghostwriters. Consequently, although the novels were originally attributed to Willy only and published under his name alone, they were later published under both names. After the death of Willy, Colette went to court to challenge her former husband's involvement in any of the writing, and subsequently had his name removed from the books. This decision however was overturned after her death, as Willy's son from a prior relationship, Jacques Gauthier-Villars, successfully sued to have his father's name restored.\n\nThe Claudine novels are thought to be roughly autobiographical.\n\n Claudine \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole (1900) \u2013 Claudine at School\n Claudine \u00e0 Paris (1901) \u2013 Claudine in Paris\n Claudine en m\u00e9nage (1902) \u2013 Claudine Married\n Claudine s'en va (1903) \u2013 Claudine and Annie\n\nReferences\n\nCollaborative book series\nBisexuality-related fiction\nSeries of books\nColette\n1900s novels\n1900s LGBT novels",

    "Shopping channels (also known in British English as teleshopping) are a type of television program or specialty channel devoted to home shopping. Their formats typically feature live presentations and demonstrations of products, hosted by on-air presenters and other spokespeople who provide a sales pitch for the product. Viewers are also instructed on how they can order the product. Shopping channels may focus primarily on mainstream merchandise, or more specialized categories such as high-end fashion and jewelry. The term can also apply to channels whose programming consists exclusively of direct-response advertising and infomercials.\n\nThe concept was first popularized in the United States in the 1980s, when Lowell \"Bud\" Paxson and Roy Speer launched a local cable channel known as the Home Shopping Club\u2014which later launched nationally as the Home Shopping Network (HSN). It later gained competition from QVC, who would eventually acquire HSN in 2017. Home shopping channels originally relied on telephone ordering, but have since been required to emphasize online shopping as part of their business models in order to compete with online-only competitors (while distinguishing themselves with their use of on-air pitches and offers to entice potential customers). In 2015, QVC acquired the retailer Zulily in an effort to expand its presence in online retail. ShopHQ is another US-based shopping channel.\n\nOutside of the US, few of the notable shopping channels are TV Shop, QVC UK in Europe, The Shopping Channel in New Zealand, Shop TV in Philippines and TSC in Canada.\n\nReferences \n\nNon-store retailing",

The more accepted theory, however, is related to President Pedro Montt, nicknamed El Mono Montt, or Monkey Montt. During an evening party, Montt prepared to leave and asked for his revolver, a Colt. He was convinced to stay and continue on with the festivities. After all of the wine was drunk and the guests still thirsty for more, mixed milk, coffee, aguardiente, and sugar.

A revised edition of this translation was published in 1923.\n\nA second translation, The Doctrine and Ritual of High Magic: A New Translation, by John Michael Greer and Mark Mikituk, was published in 2017 by TarcherPerigee.\n\nResponse\n\nModern\nThe work has recently attracted the attention of scholars for its views on the study of magic, religion, natural science and alchemy. L\u00e9vi sees magic as occupying a place between science and religion and believes that it has the potential to act as a conciliatory or mediating function between the two views. L\u00e9vi rejects views, such as E. B. Taylor's, that magic or religion is inherently irrational and has been superseded by modern science. Instead he posits magic as an \"esoteric science\" and suggests that Hermeticism could be adapted to find the underlying truth behind all magical systems, calling for a \"comparative magic.\" Levi thus posits a type of Perennialism buttressed by comparative theology and comparative religion, anticipating modern-day religious studies and paralleling contemporary comparative projects in anthropology and philology such as the work of Max M\u00fcller.\n\nContemporary\n\nReferences\n\nCitations\n\nWorks cited\n\nExternal links\n \n\n\t \n1854 non-fiction books\nOccult books\nTreatises\nLiterature first published in serial form",

    "A smart host or smarthost is an email server via which third parties can send emails and have them forwarded on to the email recipients' email servers.\n\nSmarthosts were originally open mail relays, but most providers now require authentication from the sender, to verify that the sender is authorised \u2013 for example, an ISP might run a smarthost for their paying customers only.\n\nUse in spam control efforts\nIn an effort to reduce email spam originating from their customer's IP addresses, some internet service providers (ISPs), will not allow their customers to communicate directly with recipient mailservers via the default SMTP port number 25. Instead, often they will set up a smarthost to which their customers can direct all their outward mail \u2013 or customers could alternatively use one of the commercial smarthost services.\n\nSometimes, even if an outward port 25 is not blocked, an individual or organisation's normal external IP address has a difficulty in getting SMTP mail accepted. This could be because that IP was assigned in the past to someone who sent spam from it, or appears to be a dynamic address such as typically used for home connection. Whatever the reason for the \"poor reputation\" or \"blacklisting\", they can choose to redirect all their email out to an external smarthost for delivery.\n\nReducing complexity\nWhen a host runs its own local mail server, a smart host is often used to transmit all mail to other systems through a central mail server. This is used to ease the management of a single mail server with aliases, security, and Internet access rather than maintaining numerous local mail servers.\n\nSee also\n Mail submission agent\n\nReferences\n\nEmail\nInternet terminology",

    "Binch\u014d-tan (), also called white charcoal or binch\u014d-zumi,  is a type of charcoal traditionally used in Japanese cooking. Its use dates to the Edo period, when, during the Genroku era, a craftsman named Bich\u016b-ya Ch\u014dzaemon () began to produce it in Tanabe, Wakayama. The typical raw material used to make binch\u014d-tan in Japan is oak, specifically , now the official tree of Wakayama Prefecture. Wakayama continues to be a major producer of high-quality charcoal, with the town of Minabe, Wakayama, producing more binch\u014d-tan than any other town in Japan. Binch\u014d-tan produced in Wakayama is referred to as Kish\u016b binch\u014d-tan (), Kish\u016b being the old name of Wakayama.\n\nWhite charcoal is made by pyrolysing wood in a kiln at approximately  for 120 hours, then raising the temperature to around . Once carbonised, the material is taken out and covered in a damp mixture of earth, sand and ash.\n\nBinch\u014d-tan is a type of hardwood charcoal which takes the natural shape of the wood that was used to make it. It is also harder than black charcoal, ringing with a metallic sound when struck. Due to its physical structure, binch\u014d-tan takes on a whiter or even metallic appearance and, apart from being used for cooking, has other benefits such as absorption of odors.\n\nIn comparison, oga-tan is a type of biomass briquettes - a sawdust charcoal compressed into shapes with angular edges, often with a hole in the center. There exists a common misconception amongst restaurants and chefs that causes them to refer to oga-tan as binch\u014d-tan.\n\nWind chimes and a musical instrument, the tankin (\"charcoal-xylophone\"), have been made from Binch\u014d-tan.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n \u7d00\u5dde\u5099\u9577\u70ad \u2014Making of Kish\u016b Binch\u014dtan by Wakayama Pref.\n \u70ad\u7434 \u2014Tankin (\"charcoal-xylophone\")\n \"Charcoal Adds to the Good Life\" \u2013 an article from 2001 touting the benefits of black and white charcoal, the latter including binch\u014dtan\n\nAllotropes of carbon\nFuels\nJapanese cuisine\nJapanese culture\nCharcoal",

What is known is that when L\u00fc Guang, who was then a Former Qin general, was sent by the Former Qin emperor Fu Ji\u0101n in 383 on a mission to subdue the Xiyu (\u897f\u57df, modern Xinjiang and former Soviet Central Asia) kingdoms, she did not accompany her husband but remained in the Former Qin capital Chang'an with his son L\u00fc Shao, who was probably her son as well.  \n\nWhen Chang'an fell to Western Yan forces in 385, they fled to the semi-independent state Chouchi, and after L\u00fc Guang established Later Liang after returning from his Xiyu mission and seizing Liang Province (\u6dbc\u5dde, modern central and western Gansu), they arrived in his capital Guzang (\u59d1\u81e7, in modern Wuwei, Gansu) in 389.  L\u00fc Guang, who then carried the title Prince of Sanhe, created her his princess and created L\u00fc Shao heir apparent.  \n\nBy the time he claimed the imperial title \"Heavenly Prince\" (Tian Wang) in 396 and created L\u00fc Shao crown prince, she was not mentioned, implying that she might have died by that point, and there was no further reference to her in history.  If she had in fact survived to 396, she would have likely been created empress.

    "The Thurniaceae are a family of flowering plants composed of two genera with four species. The botanical name has been recognized by most taxonomists.\n\nThe APG II system, of 2003, also recognizes such a family, and assigns it to the order Poales in the clade commelinids, in the monocots. The family consists of two genera, totalling only a few species, perennial plants of wet habitats in South America and South Africa.\n\nThis represents a slight change from the APG system, 1998, which treated the two genera as each constituting their own family (Prioniaceae and Thurniaceae), both placed in the order Poales.\n\nThe Cronquist system of 1981 also recognized such a family and placed it in the order Juncales in the subclass Commelinidae in class Liliopsida in division Magnoliophyta.\n\nThe Wettstein system, last updated in 1935, placed the family in order Liliiflorae.\n\nReferences\n\n \nPoales families\nTaxa named by Adolf Engler",

It has one runway: 13/31 is 4,001 by 75 feet (1,220 x 23 m) asphalt.\n\nIn the year ending April 4, 2023, the airport had 15,320 aircraft operations, average 42 per day: 95% general aviation,3% military, and 2% air taxi. At that time, 46 aircraft were based at the airport: 38 single-engine, 5 multi-engine, 1 jet and 2 helicopter.\n\nHistory\nThe airport opened in 1937; construction was a Works Project Administration project.  The airport was used during World War II by the Army Air Corps for antisubmarine patrols. In 1940, Eastern Air Lines stopped their one way daily routes between Beaumont and Houston. No regularly scheduled flights have taken place since.\n\nImprovements\nA $230,000 building replaced the original terminal building in the late 1970s. Other improvements included paved runways, taxiway, parking apron and lighting costing $593,000.\n\nRunway and taxiways were improved in 2009; partial financing was from a $2.9 million grant from the Texas Department of Transportation.\n\nIn 2014 facilities were completely renovated.

    "Indolamines are a family of neurotransmitters that share a common molecular structure (namely, indolamine). Indolamines are a classification of monoamine neurotransmitter, along with catecholamines and ethylamine derivatives. A common example of an indolamine is the tryptophan derivative serotonin, a neurotransmitter involved in mood and sleep. Another example of an indolamine is melatonin.\n\nIn biochemistry, indolamines are substituted indole compounds that contain an amino group.  Examples of indolamines include the lysergamides.\n\nSynthesis \n\n Indolamines are biologically synthesized from the essential amino acid tryptophan.

    "Hermann III (c.994/995 - April 1, 1012) was a member of the Conradine dynasty. He was Duke of Swabia from 1003 until 1012.\n\nLife\nHermann was the son of Herman II, Duke of Swabia and his wife Gerberga of Burgundy, daughter of Conrad I of Burgundy. He had many illustrious relatives. Through his father, Hermann was descended from Henry the Fowler; through his mother from Louis IV of France, Alfred the Great and Charlemagne. Hermann's sister, Gisela of Swabia, married Emperor Conrad II.\n\nInheritance and regency\nIn 1003, when Hermann was about nine years old, his father died and Hermann inherited the duchy of Swabia. Since he was a minor, Hermann's reign as duke was effectively controlled by his cousin, the King of Germany, Henry II, who was his guardian. Henry II was mistrustful of the Conradines. Herman III's father, Herman II, had opposed the election of Henry II as king of Germany in 1002, and promoted himself as a rival candidate for the throne. Henry II thus used his position as Hermann's guardian to limit the power of the dukes of Swabia. He took control of key places in Swabia himself (including Hohentwiel, Breisach and Z\u00fcrich), and replaced the ducal mint with a royal mint. He separated Alsace from the duchy of Swabia and gave control of Alsace to one of his relatives, Count Gerhard. Henry's control over Swabia was still present when Hermann died, aged about eighteen, in 1012.\n\nHermann III did not marry and had no heirs. The male line of the Conradines of Swabia came to an end with his death. Henry III selected Ernest to succeed him; two years later, Ernest married Hermann's sister Gisela of Swabia.\n\nNotes\n\nSources\n \nS.Weinfurter, Heinrich II.

    "Rebatching, or hand milling, is a soapmaking technique used by hobbyists and artisan soapmakers. The commercial equivalent is French milling.\n\nIn rebatching, commercially purchased or previously made soap (a soap base) is shredded or diced finely and mixed with a liquid, into which the soap shreds begin to dissolve. It is then heated at a fairly low temperature until the mass is more or less homogeneous. When it becomes translucent and reaches a thick, gel-like consistency, it is spooned or piped into molds and allowed to harden.\n\nSoapmakers frequently use rebatching as a way of adding substances that could not withstand the high temperatures or caustic chemical environment of cold process or hot process soapmaking, such as certain essential oils (for example, those with a very low flash point). The choice of liquid affects the character of the finished soap; milk is frequently used to give the soap a smooth, creamy consistency. Rebatching can also be used as a way of salvaging soap that cracked, curdled or separated while being made.\n\nAs with the melt and pour process, rebatching does not necessarily involve saponification, and as such it is a misnomer to refer to it as soap-\"making\".\n\nSoaps\nHandicrafts",

The office of chamberlains was abolished in 1826 using the Receipt of the Exchequer Act 1783, but the custody of the standards and any duties connected to them remained attached to an officer in the Exchequer until that department was abolished by the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act 1866. Meanwhile, in pursuance of recommendations of Standard Commissions of 1841 and 1854 and a House of Commons committee of 1862, the Standards of Weights, Measures, and Coinage Act 1866 was passed. This act created a special department of the Board of Trade, called the Standard Weights and Measures Department, and a head of that department styled the Warden of the Standards.

    "Serra do Bussaco ( ) is a mountain range in Portugal, formerly included in the province of Beira Litoral. The highest point in the range is the Cruz Alta at 549 m (1801\u00a0feet), which has views over the Serra da Estrela, the Mondego River valley and the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe Serra includes the buildings of a secularized Carmelite monastery, founded in 1628. The convent woods have long been known for their cypress, plane, evergreen oak, cork and other forest trees, many of which have stood for centuries and attained an immense size. A bull of Pope Gregory XV (1623), anathematizing trespassers and forbidding women to approach, is inscribed on a tablet at the main entrance; another bull, of Pope Urban VIII (1643), threatens with excommunication any person harming the trees. Located in the northwestern corner is the Mata Nacional do Bussaco (Bussaco Forest), an ancient walled arboretum.\n\nTowards the close of the 19th century the Serra de Bussaco became one of the regular halting-places for foreign, and especially for British, tourists, on the overland route between Lisbon and Porto. The Palace Hotel of Bussaco (Pal\u00e1cio Hotel do Bussaco), built between 1888 and 1905 in an exuberant Neo-Manueline style, still attracts tourists.\n\nIn 1873 a monument was erected, on the southern slopes of the Serra, to commemorate the Battle of Bussaco, in which the French, under Marshal Mass\u00e9na, were defeated by the Anglo-Portuguese Army, under Lord Wellington, on 27 September 1810.\n\nReferences\n\nMountain ranges of Portugal",

Nanorana in particular has seen big changes. As currently delineated, Nanorana is a quite large genus with 28 species, resulting from considering Chaparana, Paa, and Feirana as junior synonyms. Currently these taxa may be recognized as subgenera, but their delineation is not entirely settled and not all species have been assigned to subgenera.

Donato was initially elected as a member of the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party but resigned in 2022 and became an Independent.\n\nHistory\nThe electorate of Orange was created in 1859. Between 1920 and 1927, Orange and Hartley were absorbed into Bathurst, which elected three members under proportional representation. In 1927, Bathurst, Hartley and Orange were recreated as single-member electorates.\n\nThe area leans strongly toward the National Party. The Labor Party hasn't held the seat since 1947, although it came close to winning at a 1996 by-election.

    "North Shore is an electoral district of the Legislative Assembly in the Australian state of New South Wales, located on Sydney's lower North Shore. It is currently held by  MP Felicity Wilson.\n\nHistory\nNorth Shore was originally created as a five-member electorate with the introduction of proportional representation in 1920, replacing Middle Harbour, Mosman, St Leonards and Willoughby and named after the North Shore of Sydney Harbour.  It was abolished in 1927 and replaced by Lane Cove, Manly, Mosman, Neutral Bay, North Sydney and Willoughby.  It was recreated in 1981, replacing Kirribilli.\n\nIt was originally expected to be a very safe Liberal seat; northern Sydney has been the power base for the Liberals and their predecessors for over a century.  However, it was held by independents from 1981 to 1991\u2014most notably Ted Mack from 1981 to 1988.  The Liberals did not take the seat until 1991, but have held it with virtually no difficulty since then.\n\nWhile  frequently runs dead in northern Sydney, North Shore is very unfriendly territory for Labor even by northern Sydney standards. Labor has never tallied more than 37 percent of the two-party vote. In the last four elections, Labor candidates have been pushed into third place, and have struggled to get to 20 percent of the primary vote.\n\nMembers for North Shore\n\nElection results\n\nReferences\n\nElectoral districts of New South Wales\n1920 establishments in Australia\nNorth Shore\n1927 disestablishments in Australia\nNorth Shore\n1981 establishments in Australia\nNorth Shore",

It was one of the last battles of the Hook and Cod wars. \n\nThat war had already been won by the Cods and their Burgundian allies. In Utrecht, however, the Hooks revolted and seized the bishop, David of Burgundy at the outbreak of the Second Utrecht Civil War. Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I then won the bishop's freedom.\n\nOn 26 December 1481, Bishop David sent an army of 4,000 to 5,000 men to retake Utrecht. When his forces reached the village of Westbroek on the northern edge of Utrecht, they burned the village to the ground and killed the inhabitants. An armed mob formed in Utrecht and headed toward Westbroek to take revenge. When the mob saw the size of David's army, it tried to flee back to the city. Bishop David's army pursued them and killed everybody they could.

In Feminine Forever, Wilson promoted the use of estrogen therapy to avoid the menopause and associated symptoms. He characterized menopause as a serious disease state and made strong claims about the effectiveness and safety of menopausal hormone therapy in alleviating it and improving quality of life and health. Wilson's claims were criticized as not being based on adequate research and evidence. Subsequently, trials such as the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) contradicted Wilson's claims and showed that menopausal hormone therapy could have significant medical risks and that its benefits were not as great as once believed.\n\nWilson's early medical career was unremarkable, and he did not publish his first papers until 1962, when he was in his late 60s.\n\nIt was revealed by Wilson's son, Ronald Wilson, that Wyeth-Ayerst had secretly paid all of the fees for Wilson to write his book and also helped finance his foundation.

    "\"Unwashed and Somewhat Slightly Dazed\" is a song by English musician David Bowie, released on his 1969 album David Bowie. It was one of the first songs produced by Tony Visconti.\n\nInspiration \nIn July 1969, Bowie performed at the Maltese Music Festival while his father became sick and later died. The feel of the song was meant to show Bowie's feelings after his father's death.\n\nThe song also seems to be about social structure, as the girl in the song is very wealthy compared to the narrator. Bowie said that the song was written because he got \"funny stares\" from people.\n\nSong structure \nThe song opens with acoustic Asus2 and D9 chords. This repeats until the song enters the main structure, a new beat with guitars and harmonica. This part of the song mainly switches between C and F, but occasionally uses other chords as well. After the lyrics finish, the music continues for about two minutes before ending.\n\nReview after \"Blackstar\" \nAfter the release of \"Blackstar\" and the death of David Bowie, several lists were created that cited \"Unwashed and Somewhat Slightly Dazed\" as an important song in Bowie's history. Rolling Stone says that the song is \"pretty unremarkable except for one thing: It's the first Tony Visconti-produced David Bowie track the world ever heard.\" Hillary E. Crawford shares this opinion, only including it because \"This track, which immediately follows \"Space Oddity,\" was the first to be produced by Tony Visconti, the man who also produced Bowie's last album Blackstar.\"\n\nPersonnel \nAccording to Chris O'Leary:\n\nDavid Bowie \u2013 lead vocal\nKeith Christmas \u2013 12-string acoustic guitar\nMick Wayne \u2013 lead guitar\nTim Renwick \u2013 rhythm guitar\nJohn Lodge \u2013 bass\nJohn Cambridge \u2013 drums\nBenny Marshall \u2013 harmonica\nUnknown musicians \u2013 saxophones, trumpets\nTony Visconti \u2013 producer\n\nReferences\n\nSources \n\nDavid Bowie songs\n1969 songs\nSongs written by David Bowie",
    "In mathematics, the Cartan\u2013Dieudonn\u00e9 theorem, named after \u00c9lie Cartan and Jean Dieudonn\u00e9, establishes that every orthogonal transformation in an n-dimensional symmetric bilinear space can be described as the composition of at most n reflections.\n\nThe notion of a symmetric bilinear space is a generalization of Euclidean space whose structure is defined by a symmetric bilinear form (which need not be positive definite, so is not necessarily an inner product \u2013 for instance, a pseudo-Euclidean space is also a symmetric bilinear space). The orthogonal transformations in the space are those automorphisms which preserve the value of the bilinear form between every pair of vectors; in Euclidean space, this corresponds to preserving distances and angles. These orthogonal transformations form a group under composition, called the orthogonal group.\n\nFor example, in the two-dimensional Euclidean plane, every orthogonal transformation is either a reflection across a line through the origin or a rotation about the origin (which can be written as the composition of two reflections). Any arbitrary composition of such rotations and reflections can be rewritten as a composition of no more than 2 reflections. Similarly, in three-dimensional Euclidean space, every orthogonal transformation can be described as a single reflection, a rotation (2 reflections), or an improper rotation (3 reflections). In four dimensions, double rotations are added that represent 4 reflections.\n\nFormal statement \nLet  be an n-dimensional, non-degenerate symmetric bilinear space over a field with characteristic not equal to 2. Then, every element of the orthogonal group  is a composition of at most n reflections.\n\nSee also\n Indefinite orthogonal group\n Coordinate rotations and reflections\n Householder reflections\n\nReferences\n \n \n \n \n\nTheorems in group theory\nBilinear forms",

It was the first locomotive designed in Poland after World War I, so the design work was done jointly with Hanomag, based on the Prussian P 8 (PKP class Ok1)\n\nHistory\n\nIntroduction\nThe first five engines were built in Germany by Hanomag in 1923. Polish production started in 1928 and lasted until 1934 after which 185 locomotives had been manufactured by Fablok in Chrzan\u00f3w.  The first Polish-built locomotive (Ok22-6) was ready on December 31, 1928. Polish versions of the locomotive bore some improvements and changes compared with German ones, and were similar to PKP class Ty23. Ok22 locomotives were the first on the PKP to be equipped with electric lights.\n\nWartime\nAfter the German invasion of Poland in World War II, most Ok22 locomotives were taken into the Deutsche Reichsbahn fleet as 38 4501 to 38 4630.\n\nPresent day\nOnly two examples have survived.

Initially, he was an amatya (official) of the Magadha empire under the Haryanka dynasty. He was placed on the throne by the people who revolted against the Haryanka dynasty rule. According to the Puranas, he placed his son at Varanasi and himself ruled from Girivraja (Rajagriha). He was succeeded by his son Kalashoka (Kakavarna).\n\nEarly life\nAccording to the Mahavamsatika, Shishunaga was a son of a Licchavi ruler of Vaishali. He was conceived by a nagara-shobhini and brought up an officer of state. At the time of the revolt, he was a viceroy at Varanasi of king Nagadasaka, the last ruler of the Haryanka dynasty.\n\nReign\nShishunaga ruled from 413 BCE to 395 BCE. Initially, his capital was Rajagriha and Vaishali was his second royal residence. Later he shifted his capital to Vaishali. He conquered Avanti kingdom by defeating Nandivardhana or Avantivardhana, the last king of Pradyota dynasty.

The mayor is Halil \u00d6zcan (CHP).\n\nHistory\nThe history of Ba\u015fmak\u00e7\u0131 goes back to the Hittite era, 1750-1200 BC. It then became a colony of the Phrygians of nearby Dinar. It was subsequently possessed by Lydians, Persians, Ancient Macedonians and Seleucids, the kings of Pergamon, Romans and then Byzantines.\n\nTurkish tribes arrived in Anatolia in 1071, and one of these was the Ba\u015fmak\u00e7\u0131, who came through Azerbaijan, settling near Tarsus on the Mediterranean, where there is a village called Ba\u015fmak\u00e7\u0131 still today, and then sometime between 1100 and 1200 moving west to settle in this district of Afyon that has been called Ba\u015fmak\u00e7\u0131 ever since.\n\nThis part of Anatolia was subsequently controlled by the Germiyan dynasty, who gave the town as dowry when marrying their daughter to the Ottoman Sultan Bayezid I. Thus Ba\u015fmak\u00e7\u0131, a village of 47 families at the time, became an Ottoman land.\n\nBa\u015fmak\u00e7\u0131 was badly damaged in an earthquake in August 1892 when 300 homes were destroyed. However, no one was killed, as it was harvest time and all were in the fields.\n\nBa\u015fmak\u00e7\u0131 was not occupied during the Turkish War of Independence but many of its sons died in that war and World War I previous to it.\n\nBa\u015fmak\u00e7\u0131 today\nBa\u015fmak\u00e7\u0131 is well-established as the leading egg producing area in Turkey.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Basmakci in Afyonkarahisar \n\nPopulated places in Afyonkarahisar Province\nBa\u015fmak\u00e7\u0131 District\nDistrict municipalities in Turkey",

The Ancient Greeks arrived in 765 BC and in 670BC a colony of the Aegean Greek community of Miletos was founded, one of a chain of 90 trading posts along the Black Sea coast. By 520 BC Eynesil was in the territory of the Satrap of Pontus, a territory of the Persian Empire. This was succeeded by the Roman Empire and the Byzantines and in 1204 the Empire of Trebizond, a rump-Byzantine state that lasted until it was overthrown by Sultan Mehmet II of the Ottoman Empire in 1461.\n\nDuring the medieval period one of the most important guardians of the coastal road connecting Trabzon to Samsun was the large Byzantine garrison fort located about 3 kilometers east of modern town of Eynesil.  An archaeological and historical assessment of this site as well as a scaled plan were published in 1985.  The impressive circuit walls and defenses create two separate baileys with the remains of numerous rooms.  The site briefly served as a Russian military depot and lighthouse (1877\u201378) during the Russo-Turkish War.

    "Staincross was a Wapentake (Hundred), which is an administrative division (or ancient district), in the historic county of the West Riding of Yorkshire. It consisted of seven parishes, and included the towns of Barnsley and Penistone\n\nHistory\nStaincross was named after the village of Staincross and also included the parishes of Cawthorne, Darton, Felkirk, Hemsworth, High Hoyland, Penistone, Royston, Silkstone (including Barnsley) and Tankersley and parts of Darfield. Of the nine wapentakes in the West Riding of Yorkshire, Staincross typically had the lowest population density, which was recorded in 1867 as 27,089.\n\nThe original meeting place of the wapentake is believed to have been in, or near, to the village of Staincross, similar to the wapentakes at Ewcross and Osgoldcross. The name derives from the Old Norse of stein-kross, literally, stone cross.\n\nOriginally located in the West Riding of Yorkshire, the majority of area within Staincross Wapentake is now within South Yorkshire, with Hemsworth and surrounding villages today a part of the Wakefield Metropolitan District, within West Yorkshire. The original boundaries nestled against the wapentakes of Agbrigg to the north, Osgoldcross to the east and Strafforth to the south and south east. On the western edge, the wapentake bordered the Hamestan Hundred of Cheshire. It was estimated to have covered an area of , although, according to Domesday records, a smaller portion, geographically removed from the rest of the wapentake, was located at the village of Adlingfleet where the rivers Ouse and Trent converge.\n\nAlthough some distance from the village of Staincross, the Church of All Saints, Silkstone, was sometimes known as the \"Mother Church\" of the Staincross Wapentake.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nWapentakes of the West Riding of Yorkshire",

Gibara is the fourth largest town by population and the ninth by area in Holgu\u00edn.\n\nHistory\n\nThe main town was founded on January 16, 1817. It is also known as \"The White Town\", . Gibara has a beautiful and breezy landscape, and also possesses excellent architectural designs and a well-planned layout of its streets, houses and parks. Even so, Gibara's biggest asset, according to visitors, are its people, which are described as cooperative, friendly, affectionate, and proud of their village and of its history. It is said Admiral Christopher Columbus had remarked of Gibara's environs that \"it is the most beautiful land that human eyes saw.\"\n\n\"The White Villa\" in Gibara, although small, is said to possess a peculiar charm, exhibiting an architectural patrimony reflecting almost two centuries of history, as well as its people's cultural roots. Currently, some controversy exists about whether it was the Bay of Gibara or the Bay of Bariay that Columbus' ships reached during his first voyage to Cuba.  The island of Cuba was discovered on October 28, 1492, after the disembarkation of La Pinta, La Ni\u00f1a and La Santa Mar\u00eda, the first three European ships under the command of Columbus during his first trip toward the New World.\n\nGibara was declared a National Monument in 2002; additionally, since 2003, the International Festival of Cinema, where films are presented in a number of different categories, has been held in this small coastal town.\n\nDemographics\nIn 2004, the municipality of Gibara had a population of 72,810.

    "Skyrack was a wapentake of the West Riding of Yorkshire, England. It was split into upper and lower divisions and centred in Headingley, Leeds.  The Lower Division included the parishes of Aberford,  Bardsey, Barwick-in-Elmet, Kippax, Thorner, Whitkirk and part of Harewood, while the Upper Division included the parishes of Adel, Bingley, Guiseley and parts of Harewood, Ilkley and Otley.\n\nThe Upper division of Skyrack was bounded to the north by the River Wharfe whilst the southern edge was bounded by the River Aire. Both divisions together contained 82 settlements.\n\nThe Skyrack wapentake derives its name from a large oak that grew for centuries in Headingley. It is believed that the word \"skyrack\" comes from the Old English phrase scir ac meaning \"Shire Oak\", under which meetings were held. The tree finally collapsed in 1941. There is a plaque to commemorate it on the outside of the garden wall of the Original Oak pub. It also gives its name to the Skyrack pub opposite the Original Oak.

    "Glass cloth is a textile material woven from glass fiber yarn.\n\nHome and garden\nGlass cloth was originally developed to be used in greenhouse paneling, allowing sunlight's ultraviolet rays to be filtered out, while still allowing visible light through to plants.\n\nGlass cloth is also a term for a type of tea towel suited for polishing glass. The cloth is usually woven with the plain weave, and may be patterned in various ways, though checked cloths are the most common. The original cloth was made from linen, but a large quantity is made with cotton warp and tow weft, and in some cases they are composed entirely of cotton. Short fibres of the cheaper kind are easily detached from the cloth.\n\nIn the Southern Plains during the Dust Bowl, states' health officials recommended attaching translucent glass cloth to the inside frames of windows to help in keeping the dust out of buildings, although people also used paperboard, canvas or blankets. Eyewitness accounts indicate they were not completely successful.\n\nUse in technology\nDue to properties of glass such as heat resistance and an inability to ignite, glass has been used to create fire barriers in hazardous environments such as inside of racecars. Its poor flexibility, and its being a source of skin irritation, made the fibers inadequate for apparel uses.\n\nIts bi-directional strength make glass cloth useful for some fiberglass reinforced plastics. For example, the Rutan VariEze homebuilt aircraft uses a moldless glass cloth - epoxy composite structure and skin. Glass cloth is commonly used as the reinforcing lattice for pre-pregs.\n\nSee also \n G-10 (material)\n Glass fiber\n\nReferences \n\nWoven fabrics\nLinens\nFiberglass\nComposite materials\nFibre-reinforced polymers\nGlass applications",

    "Mickey's Racing Adventure is a racing video game developed by Rare and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy Color in 1999. It was followed by Mickey's Speedway USA in 2001.\n\nGameplay\nMickey's Racing Adventure is a single-player racing game with adventure elements. It is played from an isometric perspective and races consist of land or water tracks.\n\nDevelopment and release\nMickey's Racing Adventure was developed by Rare over the course of approximately six months. It is the company's second Game Boy Color game and its extra mini-games are based on classics such as Loco-Motion. It supports the Game Boy Color's infrared port to transmit data between machines. The game was released in November 1999.\n\nReception\n\nMickey's Racing Adventure received positive reviews from critics. IGN reviewer Craig Harris felt that it was Rare's \"first real quality Game Boy Color-exclusive title\" after their \"atrocious\" Conker's Pocket Tales, while GameSpot praised the number of tracks and characters to choose from, stating that Mickey's Racing Adventure \"shows how Game Boy racers should be done\". N64 Magazine said that the game successfully combines the exploration aspects of Rare's Diddy Kong Racing with the racing style of R.C. Pro-Am for the Nintendo Entertainment System, but criticised the lack of a multiplayer mode. Game Informer gave the game an overall score of 8 out of 10 noting the game being well designed, especially for a Disney game, and commenting that the game has plenty of racing courses, characters, power ups and vehicle upgrades concluding \"Mickey's Racing Adventure won't take you an exorbitant amount of time to finish, but you\u2019ll like it all the way to the end\".\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n1999 video games\nGame Boy Color games\nGame Boy Color-only games\nMickey Mouse video games\nNintendo games\nRacing video games\nRare (company) games\nSingle-player video games\nVideo games scored by David Wise\nVideo games developed in the United Kingdom",

The stems grow slowly and often tightly together, reaching  or more tall. It is a fan palm (Arecaceae tribe Corypheae), with the leaves with a long, smooth (unspined) petiole terminating in a rounded fan of 20\u201330 leaflets,  long, with a distinct glaucous blue-green to grey-green colour.\n\nThe flowers are borne in tall, open clusters up to  long at the top of the stems; it is usually dioecious with male and female flowers on separate plants. The fruit is a brown drupe. The individual stems are monocarpic, dying back to the ground after flowering, with the plant continuing growth from basal sprouts.\n\nCultivation \nIt is one of the hardier palms, tolerating winter frosts down to about  (possibly even ), though it requires very hot summers for good growth. It can be grown in USDA zones 6-11. It is occasionally grown as an ornamental plant in southern Europe and southern North America, but is not widely cultivated.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nFairchild Guide to Palms: Nannorrhops\nPACSOA: Nannorrhops\nScanpalm Nannorrhops\n\nCoryphoideae\nMonotypic Arecaceae genera\nFlora of Pakistan\nFlora of Iran\nFlora of Afghanistan\nFlora of the Arabian Peninsula\nDioecious plants",

    "Arima Haruzumi (\u6709\u99ac \u6674\u7d14, 1483 \u2013 March 19, 1566) was a Japanese feudal lord in the Sengoku period.\n\nBiography \nInitially known as Arima Sadazumi, he held the title of Shuri-dayu and a position in the shobanshu, the private guard of the Shogun. His tenure as lord had the Arima at the height of their power, controlling trade in the strategically important Shimabara Peninsula, near modern-day Nagasaki. Ashikaga Yoshiharu, the 12th Ashikaga sh\u014dgun, recognizing his strategic importance and strength, allowed him to take a character from his name and call himself \"Haruzumi.\"\n\nIn 1546 he attacked Ryuzoji Iekane's Mizu-ga-e Castle, and while he captured it, Iekane led a counterattack after a mere two months, recapturing it. After this, Haruzumi gave his second son in adoption to the Omura clan, and it was this son who would become \u014cmura Sumitada. In the course of his tenure as lord, Haruzumi clashed with many local daimy\u014ds such as the Goto, Hirai, Matsuura, Omura, Saigo, and Taku. He soon on expanded the Arima to control five districts of Hizen Province. As a result of his military conquests and political maneuvering, Haruzumi was able to control all of Hizen Province by way of political maneuvering.\n\nIn his later years, Portuguese vessels began to appear in the waters controlled by the Arima, and the family profited from foreign trade. While Christianity spread greatly, Haruzumi did not like the faith, and persecuted it.\n\nHis son Yoshisada succeeded him.\n\nReferences \n\nDaimyo\n1483 births\n1566 deaths",

The earliest prototypes of the A-91 bullpup were added with the grenade launcher above the barrel, and with a frontal vertical foregrip; current models are fitted with the underbarrel launcher, which serves as a forearm. The A-91 has a forward ejection system, initially developed in Tula by designers like Afanasiev during the early 1960s. In this system, the ejection port is located right above the pistol grip, and is directed forward. Extracted cases go from bolt head through the short ejection tube to the ejection port, and fall out of the gun well clear of the shooter's face, even when firing from the left shoulder. As for now, the A-91 is made in small numbers and, probably, is used by some elite police units in Russia; it is also offered for export and domestic military and police sales.\n\nADS amphibious rifle\nIn early XXI century designers at KBP designed a dual medium rifle called ADS.

    "In human anatomy, the facial skeleton of the skull the external surface of the mandible is marked in the median line by a faint ridge, indicating the mandibular symphysis (Latin: symphysis menti) or line of junction where the two lateral halves of the mandible typically fuse at an early period of life (1-2 years). It is not a true symphysis as there is no cartilage between the two sides of the mandible.\n\nThis ridge divides below and encloses a triangular eminence, the mental protuberance, the base of which is depressed in the center but raised on either side to form the mental tubercle. The lowest (most inferior) end of the mandibular symphysis \u2014 the point of the chin \u2014 is called the \"menton\".\n\nIt serves as the origin for the geniohyoid and the genioglossus muscles.\n\nOther animals\n\nSolitary mammalian carnivores that rely on a powerful canine bite to subdue their prey have a strong mandibular symphysis, while pack hunters delivering shallow bites have a weaker one. When filter feeding, the baleen whales, of the suborder Mysticeti, can dynamically expand their oral cavity in order to accommodate enormous volumes of sea water.  This is made possible thanks to its mandibular skull joints, especially the elastic mandibular symphysis which permits both dentaries to be rotated independently in two planes. This flexible jaw, which made the titanic body sizes of baleen whales possible, is not present in early whales and most likely evolved within Mysticeti.\n\nReferences\n\nNotes\n\nSources\n\n \n\nBones of the head and neck",

The town of Erbaa lies on the left bank of the Kelkit River and is surrounded by the Erbaa Plain, most of which lies in its district.\n\nOne kilometer east-southeast of Erbaa is the archaeological site of Horoztepe.\n\nEtymology\nThe name \"Erbaa\" means \"four\" in Arabic. According to the official records of the Ottoman Empire, this name started to be used beginning from the early 18th century. The name was also used as \"Nevah-i Erbaa\", which literally means \"four towns\". It refers to the period when the most important settlements between Niksar and Amasya, namely Erek, Karayaka, Sonusa (Uluk\u00f6y), and Ta\u015f\u00e2bat (Ta\u015fova) were collectively named as Nevah-i Erbaa or \"four towns\" as they were in the same region and close to one another. Even the accrued taxes of the time were recorded in this name. In 1840, the taxes collected from these four towns were registered to be 47,243 kuru\u015f.\n\nErbaa came to be used as a general name for Erek, Karayaka, Sonusa, and Ta\u015f\u00e2bat and was regarded as a district. The name Kaza-i Erbaa, or Erbaa District was also used during the Ottoman Empire. As the town of Erek developed more than the others over time, it became a district in 1872 and took the name Erbaa on its own and the others, Ta\u015f\u00e2bat, Karayaka and Sonusa became the villages of Erek, or today's Erbaa. Later, in 1944, when Ta\u015fabat or today's Ta\u015fova became a separate district in 1944, Sonusa was also annexed to Ta\u015fova.\n\nReferences\n\n \nPopulated places in Erbaa District\nDistrict municipalities in Turkey",

Jacob received Halland in 1283, but switched allegiance to the King of Norway two years later and was declared an outlaw in 1287 after the murder of Eric V of Denmark.\n\nIn Halland, Jacob built the fortresses of Hunehals and later Varberg Fortress.

    "Toxicodendron rydbergii, the western poison ivy or northern poison oak, is a species of Toxicodendron in the cashew family native to North America.\n\nDescription \nUnlike Toxicodendron radicans (eastern poison ivy), which often appears as a trailing or climbing vine, Toxicodendron rydbergii is a shrub that can grow to 1\u00a0m (3\u00a0ft) tall, rarely up to 3\u00a0m (10\u00a0ft). The leaves are trifoliate and alternate.  The leaflets are variable in size and shape, and are usually 15\u00a0cm (6\u00a0in) long, turning yellow or orange in autumn. On the compound trifoliate leaves, the two leaflets opposite each other are typically asymmetrical, in contrast to the terminal leaflet which always shows bilateral symmetry.  The fruits are small, round, and yellowish. Like other members of its genus, all parts of this plant contain urushiol, which can cause severe contact dermatitis in most individuals.\n\nDistribution and habitat \nIt is native to most of Canada from the Maritimes to British Columbia, and most of the contiguous United States except the Southeast, Nevada, Oregon and California. It is apparently extirpated from West Virginia. It can be found growing in forests, and other wooded areas, usually near streams and rivers.\n\nReferences\n\nrydbergii\nFlora of Northern America\nPlants described in 1900",

    "Pandanaceae is a family of flowering plants native to the tropics and subtropics of the Old World, from West Africa through the Pacific. It contains 982 known species in five genera, of which the type genus, Pandanus, is the most important, with species like Pandanus amaryllifolius and karuka (Pandanus julianettii) being important sources of food. The family likely originated during the Late Cretaceous.\n\nCharacteristics\nPandanaceae includes trees, shrubs, lianas, vines, epiphytes, and perennial herbs. Stems may be simple or bifurcately branched, and may have aerial prop roots. The stems bear prominent leaf scars. The leaves are very long and narrow, sheathing, simple, undivided, with parallel veins; the leaf margins and abaxial midribs are often prickly.\n\nThe plants are dioecious. The inflorescences are terminally borne racemes, spikes or umbels, with subtended spathes, which may be brightly colored. The flowers are minute and lack perianths. Male flowers contain numerous stamens with free or fused filaments. Female flowers have a superior ovary, usually of many carpels in a ring, but may be reduced to a row of carpels or a single carpel. Fruits are berries or drupes, usually multiple.\n\nPandanaceae includes five genera: Benstonea, Freycinetia, Martellidendron, Pandanus, and Sararanga. Benstonea (as subgenus \"Acrostigma\") and Martellidendron were formerly considered subgenera of Pandanus, but were recognized as distinct genera based on DNA sequencing.\n\nUses\nParticular species of Pandanus are used to make mats (e.g. Central Africa) or in food products (e.g. leaves as flavoring, or fruit in Southeast Asia).\n\nReferences\n\n \nMonocot families\nDioecious plants",

A pejorative, the term was traditionally used by the local Afro-Asiatic-speaking populations to refer in general terms to darker-skinned ethnic groups, particularly to those from communities speaking Nilo-Saharan languages of Western Ethiopia. These were regarded as slave reserves by the highlanders. The etymology of Shanqella is uncertain. It has been suggested that the appellation may stem from an Amharic epithet meaning \"black\" (or dark-skinned). However, it is likely that the term is instead of more ancient, Agaw derivation given the Agaw substratum in the Amharic language.

Similar in structure to Tchaikovsky's better-known Romeo and Juliet fantasy-overture, it contains themes depicting the stillness of the ship at sea, the grotesque nature of Caliban, and the love between Ferdinand and Miranda.  The love music is particularly strong, being reminiscent of the love music from Romeo and Juliet.\n\nTchaikovsky was much influenced by Shakespeare: in addition to Romeo and Juliet and The Tempest, he also wrote a Hamlet overture-fantasy (1888) and incidental music to Hamlet (1891).\n\nExcerpts from the score were used in the 2005 ballet Anna Karenina, choreographed by Boris Eifman.\n\nInstrumentation\nPiccolo, 2 Flutes, 2 Oboes, 2 Clarinets (B\u266d), 2 Bassoons + 4 Horns (F), 2 Trumpets (F), 3 Trombones, Tuba + Timpani, Cymbals, Bass Drum + Violins I, Violins II, Violas, Cellos, Double Basses\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nTchaikovsky Research\nSheet music\nFull Score\n\nCompositions by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky\nSymphonic poems by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky\nWorks based on The Tempest\n1873 compositions\nCompositions in F minor\nTchaikovsky\nMusic based on works by William Shakespeare",

Despite initial demand being high, the amateur writing team from Ka-Boom delivered the scripts for the first three issues months later than agreed, causing the art team trouble and also creating conflicts with Televisa's editorial representatives, which led to the cancellation of the title.\n \nThe series was advertised as being based on the style of Japanese manga, but it was only partially based on it. \n\nThe creative team was formed by Rebeca Soriano as writer, with art duties provided (in the 2 published issues) by Jorge Res\u00e9ndiz, inks by Eridan Zumaya and color by Guillermo Pi\u00f1a; writing direction by Susana Romero; art direction by Oscar Gonz\u00e1lez Guerrero, and the direction and editing of the project by Oscar Gonz\u00e1lez Loyo.\n\nReception\nThe book's first issue sold well, but the delay between the first and the second issues caused sales to drop tremendously. \nThe art received praise as the faux anime style was popular during the time of print, while the script was heavily criticized by fans to the original TV show as being poorly characterized and too disconnected from the original source.\n\nTrivia\nThis was Rebeca Soriano's only writing credit; she retired after this in order to work as a housemaid taking care of an elderly couple.\n\nSee also\n Rebelde (Mexican telenovela)\n RBD\n\n2006 comics debuts\nMexican comics titles\nRBD",

    "Civil Liberty is a fundraising organisation for \"UK nationalists\", that was run by members of the far-right British National Party (BNP) and British Democratic Party (BDP). It has been described as a front organisation.\n\nOrganisation \nCivil Liberty was set up by Kevin Scott, who was a regional organiser for the BNP until 2006. Scott has continued to run the organisation. An investigation by The Guardian established that the group's address was registered to Tyneside BNP, and its website domain was registered at the address of the BNP's website editor. Its national treasurer was the BNP's head of administration. The group raises money to support nationalists, and was set up to \"monitor anti-white racism\". The anti-fascist group Hope not Hate described the group as a \"fake 'civil rights' organisation\" and argued that its claim to support individuals \"who have fallen victim to the tyranny of government\" to only apply to white people. Scott has since joined the British Democratic Party, a BNP breakaway group founded by former Member of the European Parliament (MEP) and National Front chairman Andrew Brons.\n\nFundraising in the United States \nNick Griffin, the then leader of the BNP, was recorded at a conference organised by a former member of the Ku Klux Klan in the United States calling for American supporters of the party to give money to Civil Liberty rather than the BNP because of laws against international donations. He said the group \"helps members of the BNP and that is within the law\".

It can be formed into a sheet that looks like flat glass or an object, such as a bottle or drinking glass.\n\nDescription\nSugar glass is made by dissolving sugar in water and heating it to at least the \"hard crack\" stage (approx. 150 \u00b0C / 300 \u00b0F) in the candy making process.  Glucose or corn syrup is used to prevent the sugar from recrystallizing, by getting in the way of the sugar molecules forming crystals. Cream of tartar also helps by turning the sugar into glucose and fructose.\n\nBecause sugar glass is hygroscopic, it must be used soon after preparation, or it will soften and lose its brittle quality.\n\nSugar glass has been used to simulate glass in movies, photographs, plays and professional wrestling.\n\nOther uses \nSugar glass is also used to make sugar sculptures or other forms of edible art.\n\nSugar glass with blue dye was used to represent the methamphetamine in the AMC TV series Breaking Bad.

    "H6N2 is an avian influenza virus with two forms: one has a low and the other a high pathogenicity. It can cause a serious problem for poultry, and also infects ducks as well. H6N2 subtype is considered to be a non-pathogenic chicken virus, the host still unknown, but could strain from feral animals, and/or aquatic bird reservoirs. H6N2 along with H6N6 are viruses that are found to replicate in mice without preadaptation, and some have acquired the ability to bind to human-like receptors. Genetic markers for H6N2 include 22-amino acid stalk deletion in neuraminidase (NA) protein gene, increased N-glycosylation, and a D144 mutation of the Haemagglutinin (HA) protein gene. Transmission of avian influenza viruses from wild aquatic birds to domestic birds usually cause subclinical infections, and occasionally, respiratory disease and drops in egg production.

The song was performed in the latter half of Shakira's Oral Fixation Tour, and there is a Portuguese version called \"P\u00e9s Descal\u00e7os\".\n\nBackground and composition\nIn 1990, a thirteen-year-old Shakira signed a recording contract with Sony Music and released her debut studio album Magia in 1991, which largely consisted of tracks she had written since she was eight years old. Commercially, the project struggled, selling an underwhelming 1,200 copies in her native Colombia. Her follow-up record Peligro was released in 1993, and suffered a similar failure. Consequently, Shakira took a two-year hiatus, allowing her to complete her high school education.\n\nLooking to revive her struggling career, Shakira released her first major-label studio album Pies Descalzos in 1996 by Sony Music and Columbia Records.  Assuming a prominent position in its production, she co-wrote and co-produced each of the eleven tracks included on the record.\n\nMusic video\nThe music video was directed by Gustavo Garz\u00f3n. The video shows an upper class masquerade ball, an image often used to represent the personas people wear in society.  A door opens that shows Shakira singing and also shows images of all the rules that society has created from the past to now.\n\nIt was nominated for Video of the Year at the 9th Lo Nuestro Awards. There is also a Portuguese version of this song, called \"P\u00e9s Descal\u00e7os\".\n\nCharts\n\nReferences\n\n1996 singles\nShakira songs\nSpanish-language songs\nSongs written by Shakira\nSongs written by Luis Fernando Ochoa\n1995 songs",

Some of the outfall is also used to feed the river which flows to the Bristol Channel.\n\nThere are three reservoirs in total, one (Tank number three,  to the north of the A38 and two (Tank number one,  and number two,  to the south.\n\nThe reservoirs are operated by Bristol Water. The first opened in 1852 to store the water from the newly finished \"Line of Works\", but within two years it developed a leak and had to be drained for repair, causing serious disruption to Bristol's water supply. Over the following decades, work was undertaken to improve the water quality. First with sand filters and in 1935 with chlorination\n\nDuring 1962 maximum output was increased from  to  a day by lowering the outlet of the filtered tank and duplicating inlets to the seven filters which received microstrained water.\n\nThe stony banks on all the tanks provide a habitat for sedges.\n\nFishing (under permit) is generally for rainbow (Oncorhynchus mykiss, formerly Salmo iridia) and Brown trout (Salmo trutta morpha fario and S. trutta morpha lacustris).\n\nReferences\n\nDrinking water reservoirs in England\nReservoirs in Somerset\nEnvironment of Bristol\nProtected areas of Somerset",
    "The Markusbierg tunnels are a pair of parallel tunnels, which form the most easterly section of the A13 motorway through Luxembourg, near the town of Schengen.  The tunnels are 1575 metres in length, and descend easterly, towards the German border at a 5% gradient.  The eastern end of the tunnel runs directly to a viaduct crossing the river Moselle, which forms the border with Germany.\n\nConstruction work was initiated on 15 September 1997 and the tunnels opened to public traffic on 24 July 2003, along with the rest of the A13 motorway. Total construction costs were \u20ac65m, including \u20ac15m for the installation of added security systems.\n\nEach tunnel has regular emergency crossing points into the other, to allow escape in case of emergency.  In addition to the normal lighting of the tunnels, and because of their gradient and curve, the road edges (including the kerb) are also fully illuminated, which helps to indicate the tight radius.

Zhang Shijie gained his position in the Song administration after passing his civil service examination, eventually becoming a successful administrator overseeing civil, military, and naval duties for the Southern Song.\n\nAfter the fall of the capital Lin'an (modern-day Hangzhou), Zhang commanded the Song naval forces during the Mongol invasion of China in 1276, and served as the last commander of the Song fleet, during the attempt to escort Emperor Bing of Song and other Imperial officials as they fled the Mongols in 1279. However, Zhang's fleet was intercepted by Mongol forces under the command of Zhang Hongfan (the son of Zhang Shijie's former commander Zhang Rou) off the coast of Xinhui and destroyed at the Battle of Yamen on 19 March 1279. Prime Minister Lu Xiufu committed suicide, drowning the child Emperor with him, following their defeat. Although Zhang Shijie was able to escape with his remaining ships, he was said to have died a few days later during a storm at sea.

The mountain range roughly bisects the city area NW-SE and is in turn bisected by the mountain pass where the town of Borgholzhausen was founded. The mountainous part of the Borgholzhausen area generally reaches elevations of 200\u2013300 meters above sea level, while the pass area and other lower-lying parts are less than half that elevation.\n\nThe town center is about one kilometer east of the Johannisegge mountain and south of the Hanken\u00fcll mountain. The northern parts of Borgholzhausen are in the Ravensberger mountains, while the south is in the M\u00fcnsterland. The bedrock in the former part is a thick layer mainly of Cretaceous sediments, while the latter has a less thick layer of generally Mesozoic rocks covering the trunk of a Paleozoic mountain range.\n\nThe Borgholzhausen pass was an important route for crossing the Teutoburg Forest in the Bronze Age.

It was regarded as a \"publishing phenomenon,\" selling more than 400,000 hardcover copies, and more than two million copies in a paperback edition.\n\nIn 1944 the book was made into a movie of the same name, starring Robert Walker, Donna Reed, Keenan Wynn, Chill Wills and Robert Benchley.

It is India\u2019s first theatre designed and built keeping in mind the unique acoustic and visual requirements for the staging of Indian music, dance and related art forms, and was constructed by Larsen & Toubro Limited. The theatre was inaugurated by the then Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi on the 11 of October 1980.\n\nKeeping in mind the traditional seating requirements at Indian classical musical concerts and performances, the Tata Theatre stage is built in the almost semi-circular thrust shape. The alternate concave and convex triangular forms on the overhead and the wall panelings ensure even distribution of acoustics over the entire auditorium. The acoustic forms of high-density compressed plaster were handmade and lifted manually up into their positions. The architects  ensured that every musical instrument played in the orchestra could individually be heard and appreciated in every corner of the auditorium.\n\nThe external structure of the Tata Theatre complex has been acoustically insulated from outside interference such as road traffic and sounds from construction and maintenance activities by separate pile foundations down to the rock base.\n\nFamous artistes who have performed at the Tata Theatre over the years include Yehudi Menuhin, Ustad Vilayat Khan and M S Subbalaxmi.

    "Chicken Soup with Barley is a 1956 play by British playwright Arnold Wesker. It is the first of the 'Wesker trilogy' \u2013 being followed by Roots and I'm Talking About Jerusalem \u2013 and was first performed on stage in 1958 at the Belgrade Theatre in Coventry, transferring later that year to the Royal Court Theatre in London. It is considered to be an important play in the history of post-war British theatre, and one of the few English plays with a sympathetic portrayal of a communist family.\n\nThe play is split into three acts, each with two scenes. It spans 20 years of the lives of the Jewish, immigrant Kahn family living in 1936 in London, and traces the downfall of their ideals in a changing world, parallel to the disintegration of the family. The protagonists are the parents, Sarah and Harry, and their children, Ada and Ronnie. They are communists, and Wesker explores how they struggle to maintain their convictions in the face of the Second World War, Stalinism, and the 1956 Hungarian Revolution. Sarah is an adamant socialist; she is strong, family-minded, honest though bossy; Harry, her husband, is weak, a liar and lacks conviction; Ada is extremely passionate about what she believes in, especially Marxism, and, like the others, is also romantic both personally and politically; and finally, Ronnie is a romantic, youthful idealist.\n\nThe character of Sarah was based on Arnold Wesker's aunt, Sarah Wesker, who was a trade union activist in the East End of London.\n\nA major revival, starring Samantha Spiro, was staged at the Royal Court in the summer of 2011.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Arnold Wesker discusses Chicken Soup with Barley on the BBC World Book Club\n A review of Chicken Soup with Barley.\n Chicken Soup with Barley at the Nottingham Playhouse.\n\nPlays by Arnold Wesker\n1956 plays",

    "Thomas Creighton was a prospector who found mineral deposits in Saskatchewan.\n\nWith his partners Jack and Dan Mosher, Creighton discovered gold on the west side of Amisk Lake in 1913. This was the first significant mineral in the area, leading to an influx of more than a thousand men and women from all over Canada. By 1914 a row of tents and log cabins, along with two cookhouses capable of feeding two hundred people at a time, developed at a place known as \"Beaver City\". Soon a freighting business was set up, then barns and boarding houses were also built to look after the many travellers. With the gold rush, the freighting industry, and the fishing industry, the boom town Beaver City seemed sustainable. However, when the First World War broke out, many left or moved to Sturgeon Landing to find work in the Mandy Mine there. Beaver City began to deteriorate, and by 1918 had practically become a ghost town.\n\nOne day whilst wandering in the wilderness he came upon a copy of The Sunless City by  J. E. Preston Muddock. The story is about a man named Josiah Flintabbatey Flonatin \"Flin Flon\", who piloted a submarine through a bottomless lake. Upon passing through a hole lined with gold, he found a strange underground world. When Tom Creighton discovered a rich vein of almost pure copper, he thought of the book and called it Flin Flon.\n\nThe town of Creighton was founded in the 1930s, when some twenty homes were built on either side of the winter trail between Flin Flon and Sandy Bay (Denare). The community grew somewhat after the Saskatchewan Department of Natural Resources constructed a road from Flin Flon to Amisk Lake.\n\nA commemorative cairn to Thomas Creighton is located on Main Street near Creighton School. In 1978, the National Film Board of Canada produced the short documentary Canada Vignettes: Flin Flon about the origin of the city's name.\n\nReferences\n\nCanadian prospectors\nCanadian people of Irish descent\nYear of birth missing\nYear of death missing",

Travis (Swayze), Chrissa (Niemi), and Max (De La Pena) were three students of master choreographer Alex McGrath, but they had a falling out many years ago over a particularly difficult piece that Alex had choreographed specifically for them. Unexpectedly, McGrath dies. This reunites the three, who agree to attempt the dance piece once more to save his company. In the process, however, they all reopen old emotional wounds that had never properly healed. Travis and Chrissa have a daughter together, Bree. Bree wishes to follow in her mother's footsteps of dancing and even takes any opportunity to steal her mother's Pointe shoes and dance around the house in them, much to her mother's chagrin. It is realized that Max should be the new head of the company. Travis, Chrissa and Max each want to quit for good at some point.

    "A student leader is any student who takes on the responsibility of spreading knowledge through inspiration, tutoring, campaigns etc.\nA student leader strives to change the world by starting with their own community.\n\nPosition details\nStudent leadership positions are often made available through an application process. This process varies from school to school and position to position, some being highly selective, while others are relatively easy to fill. Some student leadership positions are unpaid, while others receive an hourly wage for their work.

    "The Twelve Grapes (Sp. , \"the twelve grapes of luck\") is a Spanish tradition that consists of eating a grape with each of the twelve clock bell strikes at midnight of December 31 to welcome the New Year. Each grape and clock bell strike represents each of the coming twelve months.\n\nThis tradition dates back from at least 1895 but was consolidated among the population in 1909. In December of that year, some Alicantese vine growers spread this custom to better sell huge numbers of grapes from an excellent harvest. According to the tradition, eating the Twelve Grapes leads to a year of good luck and prosperity. In some areas, this practice was also believed to ward off witches and evil in general, although today it is mostly followed as a tradition to celebrate and welcome the New Year.\n\nThere are two types of places where people gather to eat the grapes: at home with family members after Nochevieja dinner, or in the main squares around the country, with the most famous being the Puerta del Sol in Madrid (and where this tradition started). The Twelve Grapes are closely related to the time ball and clock of the Royal House of the Post Office in Puerta del Sol, from where the change of year is broadcast on all major national television networks and radio stations, with television broadcasting beginning in 1962 on Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola.\n\nThe Twelve Grapes have also been adopted in places with a broad cultural relation with Spain and Latin American countries, as well as Hispanic communities in countries such as the United States. This tradition is part of the Hispanic Christmas festivities.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\nNew Year celebrations\nSpanish traditions\nViticulture",

    "The Dhruva reactor is India's largest nuclear research reactor. It was the first nuclear reactor in Asia proper. Located in the Mumbai suburb of Trombay at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), it is India's primary generator of weapons-grade plutonium-bearing spent fuel for its nuclear weapons program. Originally named the R-5, this open pool reactor first went critical on 8 August 1985 after 10 years of construction. However, the unit did not attain full power until 1988. The reactor experienced at least one serious accident when  of heavy water overflowed from the reactor core in 1985 following vibration problems.\n\nDesigned as a larger version of the CIRUS reactor, Dhruva was an Indian designed project built to provide an independent source of weapons-grade plutonium free from safeguards. The Dhruva project cost 950 million rupees. The reactor uses heavy water (deuterium) as a moderator and coolant. Aluminum clad fuel rods containing natural uranium are used to obtain a maximum thermal power output of 100 megawatts. The reactor can produce  of weapons-grade plutonium per year. \n\nDhruva, in Indian mythology, is a prince blessed to eternal existence and glory as the Pole Star by Vishnu. It can also mean 'immovable' in Sanskrit.\n\nSee also \n\n N. S.

    "Whortle's Hope is a dark fantasy novel for children by British author Robin Jarvis. It is the second book in The Deptford Mouselets series, prequels to Jarvis's Deptford Mice trilogy aimed at a slightly younger audience. It was first published in the United Kingdom in 2007. The story focuses on Whortle Nep, a fieldmouse who was a minor character in The Crystal Prison, and is set a year prior to that book's events.\n\nSynopsis\nIn the story, which takes place in the summer before the events of The Crystal Prison, it is almost the time of the Fennywolde games, when the young field mice compete to see who will have the honour of being the head sentry of the cornfield for the entire summer. Young Whortle longs to win the competition, but not if it means his friends are going to sabotage the other competitor's chances. He wants to win on his own merits, but soon realises winning isn't the most important thing as another mouse needs the prize more than he does.\n\nReception\nJohn Lloyd of The Bookbag gave Whortle's Hope a five star review, calling it \"an essential addition to the bookshelves of anybody who has read Robin Jarvis before, and despite filling in blanks elsewhere in the series for fans, it really works as an initial launch into the rest.\"\n\nReferences\n\n2007 British novels\nBritish fantasy novels\nNovels by Robin Jarvis\nThe Deptford Mice series\nHeadline Publishing Group books",

Russo, known also as the screenwriter for Night of the Living Dead.\n\nPremise\nIn the Deep South, a diabolical, machete-wielding voodoo priest (Tony Todd) is busily turning Haitian migrant farm workers into flesh-eating, zombie slaves. However, his plans are disrupted by the arrival of two college students searching for a missing colleague who turns out to have been one of the priest's earlier zombie experiments.\n\nCast\n Tony Todd as Makoute\n Raymond St. Jacques as Claude\n Theresa Merritt as Madame Daslay\n Gina Gershon as Tina\n J.

Its shape is classified as SA(s)bc, meaning that it has moderately wound spiral arms and no ring.\nBright blue areas of star formation can be seen in the spiral arms, while the yellowish central nucleus contains older-population stars. NGC 1309 is one of over 200 members of the Eridanus Group of galaxies.\n\nSupernova 2002fk\nSN 2002fk was discovered jointly by Reiki Kushida of the Yatsugatake South Base Observatory, Nagano Prefecture, Japan; and Jun-jie Wang and Yu-Lei Qiu of the Beijing Astronomical Observatory on Sept. 17.719 UT.\nWhen it was discovered it was magnitude ~15.0; it was estimated to have reached maximum magnitude of ~13.0 before fading away. It was a Type Ia supernova (i.e., the progenitor star was white dwarf). White dwarfs are older stars that have used up almost all of their main fuel (the lighter elements such as hydrogen and helium).

    "Fielfraz was a Danish band, which had its heyday between 1990 and 1996. The band members were Claus Hempler on guitar and vocals, Nils Brakchi on bass, Kenneth Priisholm on guitar (lead) and Jens Langhorn on drums.\n\nAfter several years of building up a live reputation in Odense, Fielfraz broke through with their very first record Shine, a Beatlesque guitar-oriented rock record. 1992's Electric Eel also included big radio hits like Surfer and Naked but the album as a whole was a lesser success. The third album, Slick, came late in 1996 and although widely critically acclaimed, it was largely ignored by the public.\n\nFielfraz continued to perform live occasionally, but Priisholm eventually left the band for good, leaving Fielfraz as a trio which released Hempler in 2004.\n\nFielfraz have been cited as an influence on Danish rock and grunge bands that broke through in the early 1990s like Kashmir and Dizzy Mizz Lizzy. However Fielfraz\u00b4 influences were primarily British; Priisholms guitar play was influenced by new wave like XTC and experimental rock like King Crimson and Claus Hemplers lyrics and vocal talent rendered Elvis Costello and Frank Sinatra, much more than hardcore punk and hard rock.\n\nFielfraz' time took place in a transitional period in the history of Danish rock, that broke the pop hegemony established by acts like Gnags, TV-2 and Sanne Salomonsen, in the 1980s. Alongside a few other British influenced 1990s acts like The Sandmen and Simcess, and the American influenced rock of D-A-D, they probably made the commercial breakthrough for the Danish grunge wave possibly in Denmark, by getting airplay on the dominating pop station, the national Danish radio (Danmarks Radio, P3).\n\nDiscography\n Shine - Genlyd/BMG, 1990 \n Electric Eel - Genlyd/BMG, 1992 \n Slick - Virgin, 1996\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Brakchi\n\nDanish rock music groups",

    "Michael D. Bissonnette is the former mayor of Chicopee, Massachusetts. Bissonnette was first elected mayor in a landslide in the November 2005 election after he defeated embattled mayor Richard Goyette, who has been arrested weeks prior on federal extortion charges. Bissonnette served as mayor from 2006 through 2013, but was unseated by Richard J. Kos, who had  previously served as mayor, in the 2013 general election. \n\nAfter leaving the mayor's office, he served as interim DPW director for the Town of Greenfield from November 2014 until May 2015. He challenged Kos to a rematch in 2015 but was unsuccessful. He returned to his law practice shortly thereafter. In 2019 Kos announced he would not seek re-election and Bissonnette was one of several candidates to run for the seat. He was eliminated in the City's preliminary election in September of 2019.\n\nBissonnette lives in Chicopee with his wife Erin.\n\nChicopee is a city in Western Massachusetts.

    "The bare-throated tiger heron (Tigrisoma mexicanum) is a wading bird of the heron family, Ardeidae, found from Mexico to northwestern Colombia, with one recorded sighting from the United States in Hidalgo County, Texas. It is  in length and weighs .\n\nThis large species is found in more open habitats than other Tigrisoma herons, such as river and lake banks. It waits often motionless for suitable prey such as fish, frogs or crabs to come within reach of its long bill.\n\nThis is a solitary breeder, not normally found in heron colonies. The nest is a small flattish stick platform in a tree into which 2\u20133 green-tinged white eggs are laid.\n\nDescription\nThe throat is bare and is greenish-yellow to orange in all plumages. The adult has black crown and light grey sides of the head, the sides of the neck and the upperparts otherwise blackish narrowly barred buff. The median stripe down the fore-neck is white-bordered with black; the remaining underparts are dull cinnamon brown. The juvenile is buff coarsely barred with black, more mottled and vermiculated on wings; the throat, median underparts, and belly are whitish.\n\nThe flight is heavy, and the call is a hoarse howk-howk-howk. Males also give a booming hrrrowwr! call, especially at sunset. During emission of the call, the beak opens wide and undulations can be seen along the course of the throat from mid-thorax caudally.\n\nReferences\n\n Robert S. Ridgely and John A.

    "The Castle is a video game released by ASCII Corporation in 1986 for the FM-7 and X1 computers. It was later ported to the MSX and NEC branded personal computers, and got a single console port for the SG-1000. The game is set within a castle containing 100 rooms, most of which contain one or more puzzles.\n\nIt was followed by Castlequest (Castle Excellent in Japan). Both games are early examples of the Metroidvania genre.\n\nGameplay\nThe object of the game is to navigate through the Castle to rescue the Princess. The player can push certain objects throughout the game to accomplish progress. In some rooms, the prince can only advance to the next room by aligning cement blocks, Honey Jars, Candle Cakes, and Elevator Controlling Block. Additionally, the player's progress is blocked by many doors requiring a key of the same color to unlock, and a key is removed from the player's inventory upon use. The prince must be standing on a platform next to the door to be able to unlock it, and cannot simply jump or fall and press against the door. The player can navigate the castle with the help of a map that can be obtained early in the game. The map will provide the player with a matrix of 10x10 rooms and will highlight the room in which the princess is located and the rooms that he had visited. The player must also avoid touching enemies like Knights, Bishops, Wizards, Fire Spirits, Attack Cats and Phantom Flowers.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n1986 video games\nHAL Laboratory games\nMetroidvania games\nMSX games\nSG-1000 games\nNEC PC-6001 games\nNEC PC-8801 games\nNEC PC-9801 games\nFM-7 games\nSharp X1 games\nVideo games developed in Japan\nVideo games set in castles\nSingle-player video games",

    "In political jargon, a self-licking ice cream cone is a self-perpetuating system that has no purpose other than to sustain itself. The phrase appeared to have been first used in 1991\u20131992, in a book about Gulf War weapons systems by Norman Friedman, and On Self-Licking Ice Cream Cones, a paper by Pete Worden about NASA's bureaucracy, to describe the relationship between the Space Shuttle and Space Station.\n\nSince then, the term has been used to describe the purported habit of government-funded organisations and programs spending taxpayer money to lobby for more funding from the taxpayer. Other things compared have included financial bubbles, chatshows and reality television. In The Irish Times, Kevin Courtney observed that \"many organisations are also stuck in limbo, destined to keep lurching on without ever achieving their stated goal.

    "In population genetics, a selection coefficient, usually denoted by the letter s, is a measure of differences in relative fitness. Selection coefficients are central to the quantitative description of evolution, since fitness differences determine the change in genotype frequencies attributable to selection.\n\nThe following definition of s is commonly used. Suppose that there are two genotypes A and B in a population with relative fitnesses  and  respectively. Then, choosing genotype A as our point of reference, we have , and , where s measures the fitness advantage (s>0) or disadvantage (s<0) of B.\n\nFor example, the lactose-tolerant allele spread from very low frequencies to high frequencies in less than 9000 years since farming with an estimated selection coefficient of 0.09-0.19 for a Scandinavian population. Though this selection coefficient might seem like a very small number, over evolutionary time, the favored alleles accumulate in the population and become more and more common, potentially reaching fixation.\n\nSee also\nEvolutionary pressure\n\nReferences\n\nPopulation genetics\nEvolutionary biology",

    "A lint roller or lint remover is a roll of one-sided adhesive paper on a cardboard or plastic barrel that is mounted on a central spindle, with an attached handle.  The device facilitates the removal of lint or other small fibers from most materials such as clothing, upholstery and linen. Once expended, the roll can typically be replaced with a \"refill\" roll. Invented in 1956 by Nicholas McKay, Sr., his most well-known (and first commercial) product was the Lint Pic-Up, the world's first lint roller.\n\nReusable lint rollers use elastomers, including silicones and polystyrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene as a reusable tacky surface. \nThe material is similar to polymers used in walking toys such as Wacky WallWalker.\n\nA lint roller's design enables fast 360 degree rotation, which facilitates the easy removal of unsightly fiber (often animal hair). Lint rollers can be purchased in many sizes, from pet stores, supermarkets and online.\n\nThe product is popular among dog and cat owners, as it will also remove dog and cat hair from fabrics, carpets etc.\n\nA similar device, the lint brush uses a fabric cushion mounted to a handle, that when rubbed one way across the fabric to be cleaned, picks up the small fibers. By reversing the direction of movement across the fabric or by picking off the excess lint, it is possible to clean the lint brush. Some lint brushes are double sided in order to allow the brush to be used in both directions and to extend the use of the brush by limiting wear.\n\nSee also \n\n Lint (material)\n List of cleaning tools\n Nicholas McKay\n\nReferences\n\nCleaning tools\nAmerican inventions",

In an effort to discover its function, he removed the organ from a dog. The dog was then noticed frequently urinating on the floor, although it was house trained. Mering realised that this was a symptom of diabetes and tested the urine, which was found to be high in sugar, confirming his suspicion.\n\nJosef von Mering helped to discover barbiturates, a class of sedative drugs used for insomnia, epilepsy, anxiety, and anesthesia. In 1903, he published observations that barbital (then known as diethyl-barbituric acid) has sedative properties in humans. In 1904, he helped to launch barbital under the brand name Veronal. Veronal was the first commercially available barbiturate sedative in any country.

The tribe was absorbed by the Polans in the 10th century.\n\nBavarian Geographer\n\nThe medieval chronicle claims that Glopeani controlled 400 gords (fortified wooden settlements), as if the tribe was dominant in the area; however, the archeological research in Kruszwica has failed to uncover the fortress, although it does indicate the presence of a large settlement. A possible resolution has been offered by Gerard Labuda who hypothesized that the \"Goplanie\" were the same as, or a part of, the Polans, whose main center was located at Gniezno.\n \nThe chronicle doesn't indicate the location of the tribe; however, it can be inferred from the list of neighboring tribes and their known locations: #14 Osterabtrezi (identified as Eastern Obodrites), #15 Miloxi, #16 Phesnuzi, #17 Thadesi, #18 Glopeani, #19 Zuireani, #20 Busani (identified as Buzhans on the Bug river). The position on the list suggest the Glopeani tribe might have lived in Pomerania, Great Poland or Masovia.\n\nSee also\nList of medieval Slavic tribes\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\nEarly medieval Poland\nWest Slavic tribes\nKuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship",

    "Corners is a Children's BBC children's television series of the 1980s. Produced by Alison Stewart, the format of the programme was that viewers would submit questions and queries (usually general knowledge, but sometimes metaphysical or scientific), and the two hosts, Tracy Brabin (later Sophie Aldred and then Diane-Louise Jordan) and Simon Davies, would try to answer the questions, aided by an anthropomorphised animal puppet, Jo Corner, who was performed and puppeteered by Robin Stevens (who later performed as Tom on Ragdoll's Tots TV). Being children's programming, the explanations used humour to convey information and frequently involved demonstrations which degenerated into slapstick humour.  Songs were also used.  A show with a similar format, \"Dear Mr. Barker\", aired on CBBC in the mid-1990s, but did not last long.\n\nOne of the presenters of the show was Sophie Aldred, who later became famous for playing the role of Ace in the television series Doctor Who (in one segment prior to her involvement in Who, Aldred met Keff McCulloch to discover how the new Doctor Who theme tune was composed).

    "The Volunteer Defence Corps (VDC) was an Australian part-time volunteer military force of World War II modelled on the British Home Guard. The VDC was established in July 1940 by the Returned and Services League of Australia (RSL) and was initially composed of ex-servicemen who had served in World War I. The government took over control of the VDC in May 1941, and gave the organisation the role of training for guerrilla warfare, collecting local intelligence and providing static defence of each unit's home area. General Harry Chauvel, who had retired in 1930, was recalled to duty in 1940 and appointed Inspector-General of the VDC. Chauvel held this position until his death in March 1945.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the Pacific War, the Government expanded the VDC in February 1942. Membership was open to men aged between 18 and 60, including those working in reserved occupations. As a result, there were, by 1944, nearly 100,000 men in the VDC, organized into 111 battalions consisting of about 1,500 full-time personnel, over 30,000 part-time active members and over 43,000 part-time reserve members of the Volunteer Defence Corps.\n\nAs the perceived threat to Australia declined the VDC's role changed from static defence to operating anti-aircraft artillery, coastal artillery and searchlights. Members of inland VDC units were freed from having to attend regular training in May 1944 and the VDC was officially disbanded on 24 August 1945.\n\nGallery\n\nSee also\nAuxiliary Units\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nMilitary units and formations of Australia in World War II\nInfantry units and formations of Australia\nMilitary units and formations established in 1940\nMilitary units and formations disestablished in 1945\nMilitias in Oceania\nCivil defense\nVolunteering in Australia",

    "The Kadowaki\u2013Woods ratio is the ratio of A, the quadratic term of the resistivity and \u03b32, the linear term of the specific heat. This ratio is found to be a constant for transition metals, and for heavy-fermion compounds, although at different values.\n\nIn 1968 M. J. Rice pointed out that the coefficient A should vary predominantly as the square of the linear electronic specific heat coefficient \u03b3; in particular he showed that the ratio A/\u03b32  is material independent for the pure 3d, 4d and 5d transition metals. Heavy-fermion compounds are characterized by very large values of A and \u03b3. Kadowaki and Woods showed that A/\u03b32 is material-independent within the heavy-fermion compounds, and that it is about 25 times larger than in aforementioned transition metals.\n\nAccording to the theory of electron-electron scattering the ratio A/\u03b32 contains indeed several non-universal factors, including the square of the strength of the effective electron-electron interaction. Since in general the interactions differ in nature from one group of materials to another, the same values of A/\u03b32 are only  expected within a particular group.  In 2005 Hussey proposed a re-scaling of A/\u03b32 to account for unit cell volume, dimensionality, carrier density and multi-band effects. In 2009 Jacko, Fjaerestad, and Powell demonstrated fdx(n)A/\u03b32 to have the same value in transition metals, heavy fermions, organics and oxides with A varying over 10 orders of magnitude, where fdx(n) may be written in terms of the dimensionality of the system, the electron density and, in layered systems, the interlayer spacing or the interlayer hopping integral.\n\nSee also\n\n Wilson ratio\n\nReferences\n\nCorrelated electrons\nCondensed matter physics\nFermions",

    "Bara Kaman is the unfinished mausoleum of Ali Adil Shah II in Bijapur, Karnataka in India.\n\nAli Adil Shah of the Adil Shahi dynasty wanted to build a mausoleum of unmatched architectural quality. It was planned that twelve arches would be placed vertically as well as horizontally surrounding the tomb of Ali Adil Shah. However, for unknown reasons the work on the structure was left incomplete: only two arches were raised vertically. Rumour has it that the construction of the mausoleum was stopped because once completed its shadow would touch the Gol Gombaz. Nowadays the remains of the twelve horizontally placed arches can still be seen.\n\nThe site is managed by the Archaeological Survey of India.\n\nThe Bara Kaman was built in 1672AD, by Ali Adil Shah II, and was supposed to be the burial mausoleum for the king and his wives. Bara Kaman has the tombs of Ali Adil Shah II, his wife Chand Bibi, his mistresses and his daughters.\n\nThe architect of Bara Kaman was Malik Sandal.

    "The bacon and egg pie is a savoury pie consisting of a crust containing bacon, egg and sometimes onion, mushrooms, bell peppers, peas, tomato, fresh herbs and cheese. It is popular in New Zealand. However, bacon and egg pie originated during the Middle Ages in Cornwall and is still a popular pie cooked in Cornish homes today (although rarely found in Cornish bakeries). For many Cornish people, a bacon and egg pie is more of a taste of home than the famous Cornish pasty.  Bacon and egg pie may be served with ketchup, which can be combined with Worcestershire sauce and drizzled over the filling before the pie is baked and some versions have a rising agent such as baking powder mixed into the egg to make a fluffier filling.\n\nComposition\nThe pie is often constructed with shortcrust pastry or other stable base crust. The crust is usually topped with a pastry lid, but is sometimes left open.\n\nA bacon and egg pie differs from a quiche, most notably due to the absence of cheese and milk and the presence of an upper crust. Also the eggs are not beaten and are whole, or at the most yolks pierced. The pie also tends to have a heavier texture and feel, and is generally high in calories.\n\nAlthough the bacon and egg combination is not unique to any country, its use in modern cooking is notable in New Zealand, Canada and Australia. Recipes for it have been found as early as The Experienced English Housekeeper in 1769.\n\nSee also\n\n Cornish pasty\n List of pies, tarts and flans\n Quiche\n Steak and kidney pie\n\nReferences\n\nBacon dishes\nBritish pies\nEnglish cuisine\nNew Zealand pies\nSavoury pies\nAustralian pies\nNational dishes\nEgg dishes",

Her husband was the developmentally disabled Emperor An.\n\nLife \nWang Shen'ai was the daughter of the official Wang Xianzhi, the son of the famed official and calligrapher Wang Xizhi. Her mother Princess Xin'an was the daughter of Emperor Jianwen, making her and her husband cousins.  In 396, while he was still crown prince under his father Emperor Xiaowu, they married, and she became crown empress.  She was 12, and he was 14.  As he was described to be so developmentally disabled that he could not speak or dress himself, or express whether he was full or hungry, it was unlikely that their marriage was consummated; in any case, they had no children.  Later that year, after Emperor Xiaowu was killed by his concubine Honoured Lady Zhang after humiliating her, Emperor An became emperor. On 3 May 397, she was created empress.\n\nVery little is known about Empress Wang's life as empress. In 403, after Emperor An's throne was usurped by the warlord Huan Xuan, she was effectively put under house arrest with her husband. In 404, after Liu Yu started a rebellion to reestablish Jin, Huan Xuan had her and her husband transported west with him after he resolved to flee west from the capital Jiankang, but on the way, Huan Xuan's brother-in-law Yin Zhongwen (\u6bb7\u4ef2\u6587) rebelled against him and transported her and Emperor Mu's Empress He Fani back to Jiankang. Later that year, after Huan Xuan was killed and Emperor An was seized back from Huan Xuan's nephew Huan Zhen (\u6853\u632f), he was reunited with her. She died in  September or October 412 and was buried with honors due an empress.\n\nReferences \n\n|-\n\n|-\n\n|-\n\n|-\n\n|-\n\n384 births\n412 deaths\nJin dynasty (266\u2013420) empresses\n4th-century Chinese women\n5th-century Chinese women\nHuan Chu people\n4th-century Chinese people\n5th-century Chinese people",

    "A cystidium (: cystidia) is a relatively large cell found on the sporocarp of a basidiomycete (for example, on the surface of a mushroom gill), often between clusters of basidia. Since cystidia have highly varied and distinct shapes that are often unique to a particular species or genus, they are a useful micromorphological characteristic in the identification of basidiomycetes. In general, the adaptive significance of cystidia is not well understood.\n\nClassification\n\nBy position\nCystidia may occur on the edge of a lamella (or analogous hymenophoral structure) (cheilocystidia), on the face of a lamella (pleurocystidia), on the surface of the cap (dermatocystidia or pileocystidia), on the margin of the cap (circumcystidia) or on the stipe (caulocystidia).  Especially the pleurocystidia and cheilocystidia are important for identification within many genera.  Sometimes the cheilocystidia give the gill edge a distinct colour which is visible to the naked eye or with a hand lens.\n\nBy morphology\nChrysocystidia are cystidia whose contents contain a distinct refractive yellow body, that becomes more deeply yellow when exposed to ammonia or other alkaline compounds. Chrysocystidia are characteristic of many (though not all) members of the agaric family Strophariaceae.\n\nGloeocystidia have an oily or granular appearance under the microscope.  Like gloeohyphae, they may be yellowish or clear (hyaline) and can sometimes selectively be coloured by sulphovanillin or other reagents. Metuloids are thick-walled cystidia with an apex having any of several distinct shapes.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n BCERN Glossary: Cystidia\n \"Using a Microscope: Basidia and Cystidia\" by Michael Kuo.

    "The Hive is a recording studio in North Hollywood, Los Angeles at 5500 Cahuenga Blvd, owned and run by the members of the alternative rock band 311.\n\nOrigin \nIn 2000, after finishing touring for Soundsystem, the five members of 311 grew distraught with having to pay upwards of $2,000 a day in professional recording studios. Seeking a more independent-style place to work, they found a place in North Hollywood where they could record and pay rent of $3,000 a month. The band soon loaded in two 24 track analog tape machines and Pro Tools technology, fully furnished the place, and began working on their next album.\n\nRecordings done at the Hive \nPrior to 311 purchasing The Hive, it was actively used as a music studio in the 1970s and 1980s. Notable acts such as Missing Persons and Adam Ant have recorded there. Just before 311 started using it, it was used as a voice-over studio for movies.\n\nSince 311 moved into the studio, they have recorded and mixed six albums at The Hive; 2001's From Chaos, 2003's Evolver, 2005's Don't Tread on Me, 2009's Uplifter, 2011's Universal Pulse and 2014's Stereolithic. The band worked with producer Ron Saint Germain on From Chaos, Evolver, and Don't Tread on Me, while Bob Rock produced Uplifter and Universal Pulse, and Scott Ralston produced Stereolithic, making it the first time since 1999's Soundsystem that he produced a 311 album.\n\nOther, lesser-known recording artists have also recorded sessions at The Hive, the most notable being the Volcom Entertainment act Pepper who recorded the minor-hit \"Give It Up\" at The Hive.\n\nThe Hive can be seen in more detail on the Enhanced CD features on From Chaos and Evolver.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \"L.A.

Tiny Sepuku has been distributed by Universal Press Syndicate/Universal Uclick/Andrews McMeel Syndication since April 3, 2003.\n\nBackground\nThe humor is occasionally self-parodying where the author may make light of his own experiences, and it is frequently cynical on the topic of love. Nevertheless, the comic occasionally dispenses semi-serious advice and explores relationship issues. Among the recurring cast of characters is a cat resembling the Hello Kitty character, along with a bunch of other drawings which frequently act out the adult situations in the letters.

    "The Lake Ontario Shore Railroad (LOSRR) was a short-lived common carrier railroad in New York that was absorbed by the Rome, Watertown and Ogdensburg Railroad.\n\nConstruction \nThe LOSRR was chartered to be built from Suspension Bridge, New York to Oswego, New York in 1858.  The Lake Ontario Shore Railroad Company was founded in Oswego on March 27, 1868. Under Chief Engineer James Ross, work commenced in August 1871 in Red Creek, New York.  Tracks were open to Oswego, New York in 1873.\n\nEarly Death \nDespite heavy support from on-line and planned on-line communities, the LOSRR was unable to handle its great financial obligations.  Reasons include a lack of manufacturing industries, bypassing Rochester, New York and close competition with the New York Central Railroad.  Construction only got as far as Kendall, New York.  On September 22, 1874, the railroad was sold in court under foreclosure to the Rome, Watertown and Ogdensburg Railroad, who reorganized the railroad as the Lake Ontario Railroad Company on September 29.  On October 22, this company and the RW&O made an agreement to consolidate, which was filed with the New York Secretary of State on December 23, 1875.\n\nSee also \nList of defunct New York railroads\n\nReferences \nHojack History\nRome Watertown and Ogdensburg Railroad\n\nDefunct New York (state) railroads\nPredecessors of the New York Central Railroad\nRailway companies established in 1868\nRailway companies disestablished in 1874",
    "For interest rate swaps, the Swap rate is the fixed rate that the swap \"receiver\" demands in exchange for the uncertainty of having to pay a short-term (floating) rate, e.g. 3 months LIBOR over time. (At any given time, the market's forecast of what LIBOR will be in the future is reflected in the forward LIBOR curve.) Analogous to YTM for bonds, the swap rate is then the market's quoted price for entering the swap in question.\n\nAt the time of the swap agreement, the total value of the swap's fixed rate flows will be equal to the value of expected floating rate payments implied by the forward LIBOR curve; see Swap (finance)#Valuation.\nAs forward expectations for LIBOR change, so will the fixed rate that investors demand to enter into new swaps. \nSwaps are typically quoted in this fixed rate, or alternatively in the \u201cswap spread,\u201d which is the difference between the swap rate and the U.S. Treasury bond yield (or equivalent local government bond yield for non-U.S. swaps) for the same maturity.\n\nIn most emerging markets with underdeveloped government bond markets, the swap curve is more complete than the treasury yield curve, and is thus used as the benchmark curve.\n\nReferences\n\nSwaps (finance)\nFinancial markets",

    "Dave Line (1942 \u2013 1980) was a British beer author. An electrical engineer by profession, he is regarded as a pioneer in homebrewing during the 1970s because at the time homebrewing as a hobby was in its infancy. At the time of his early death from cancer he was 37, living in Southampton, was married and had a son.\n\nHomebrewing\nIn 1963, it had become free to homebrew in the UK, previously requiring an annual 5 Shilling licence, but would not yet become legal in the U.S. until President Jimmy Carter signed a bill into law in 1978 legalizing it.\n\nPeople wanted to brew beer that matched the quality of commercial beer. In his first book \"The Big Book of Brewing\", Dave Line helped people to begin to reach the quality they were looking for, by using ingredients and processes that were used in breweries, with simple homebrewing equipment.\n\nAt the time people were not getting satisfactory results, because they were using substandard ingredients, low quality syrups or beer kits, baker's yeast, and were not technically informed in the processes of brewing. He advocated the use of proper brewer's yeast, whole-grain barley malts, whole hops, and even went into simple analysis and comparison of the chemistry of water used for brewing different beers, and rudimentary water treatment. He also encouraged sterilisation and proper cleaning of equipment.\n\nHe was a regular contributor to Amateur Winemaker, and in a decade, probably had more recipes published than anyone else.\n\nBibliography\n The Big Book of Brewing (1974) \n Brewing Beers Like Those You Buy (1978)\n Beer Kits and Brewing (1980)\n\nReferences\n\nHomebrewing\nYear of birth uncertain\nBeer writers\n1979 deaths\n1942 births\nBritish male non-fiction writers\n20th-century British male writers\n20th-century British non-fiction writers\nBritish food writers\nDeaths from cancer in England",

    "Elfriede Martha Blauensteiner (22 January 1931 \u2013 18 November 2003), dubbed The Black Widow, was an Austrian serial killer who murdered at least three victims by poison. In each case, she inherited the victim's possessions.\n\nCrimes \n\nOn 7 March 1997, Blauensteiner was found guilty of murdering 77-year-old Alois Pichler and sentenced to life imprisonment. Her former lawyer Harald Schmidt was jailed for seven years for being an accomplice to grievous bodily harm and for forging the will of Alois Pichler. She was a gambling addict, and it is believed that she would deliberately date rich elderly men and poison them before gambling away the money which had been left to her in their fabricated wills. Four years later, she was found guilty of murdering her 64-year-old husband Friedrick Doecker and 84-year-old female neighbour Franziska Koeberl. Although she was only convicted of a total of three murders, Austrian police believe that she may have murdered at least 10 people. Keoberl is believed to have been her only female victim.\n\nAfter serving less than seven years of her life sentence, Blauensteiner died from a brain tumour on 18 November 2003, in a Vienna hospital.

    "In group theory, Higman's embedding theorem states that every finitely generated recursively presented group R   can be embedded as a subgroup of some finitely presented group G. This is a result of Graham Higman from the 1960s.\n\nOn the other hand, it is an easy theorem that every finitely generated subgroup of a finitely presented group is recursively presented, so the recursively presented finitely generated groups are (up to isomorphism) exactly the finitely generated subgroups of finitely presented groups.\n\nSince every countable group is a subgroup of a finitely generated group, the theorem can be restated for those groups.\n\nAs a corollary, there is a universal finitely presented group that contains all finitely presented groups as subgroups (up to isomorphism);  in fact, its finitely generated subgroups are exactly the finitely generated recursively presented groups (again, up to isomorphism).\n\nHigman's embedding theorem also implies the Novikov-Boone theorem (originally proved in the 1950s by other methods) about the existence of a finitely presented group with algorithmically undecidable word problem. Indeed, it is fairly easy to construct a finitely generated recursively presented group with undecidable word problem. Then any finitely presented group that contains this group as a subgroup will have undecidable word problem as well.\n\nThe usual proof of the theorem uses a sequence of HNN extensions starting with R and ending with a group G which can be shown to have a finite presentation.\n\nReferences\n\nInfinite group theory\nTheorems in group theory",

    "Spring Song (in Swedish: ; in Finnish: ), Op.\u00a016, is a single-movement tone poem for orchestra written in 1894 by the Finnish composer Jean Sibelius.\n\nHistory\nThe piece was initially composed as Improvisation for Orchestra, in the key of D\u00a0major. It premiered on 21\u00a0July 1894 at an outdoor festival in Vaasa, organized by the  (). Short, lyrical, and delicately scored, Sibelius's piece was ill-suited for the open-air concert, and the audience received it less enthusiastically than another work on the program: Korsholm, by Sibelius's brother-in-law and friend Armas J\u00e4rnefelt. Shortly therefore, Sibelius withdrew Improvisation for revision. In 1895, he recast it in F\u00a0major and retitled the work Spring Song (), appending the subtitle \"The Sadness of Spring\" to that (unpublished) version.\n\nStructure\nThe work is scored for 2 flutes (both doubling piccolo), 2 oboes, 2 clarinets (in B), 2 bassoons, 4 horns (in F), 3 trumpets (in F), 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, glocken, violins, violas, cellos and double basses. Spring Song takes about 8 minutes to play.\n\nThe tempo marking is: Tempo moderato\u00a0e sostenuto. The piece contains an optimism that is relatively rare among Sibelius' works. It is known for its prominent use of bells at the end of the song.\n\nDiscography\nThe sortable table below lists commercially available recordings of Spring Song:\n\nNotes, references, and sources\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nSymphonic poems by Jean Sibelius\n1894 compositions\nCompositions in F major",

    "Rhodogune (; 2nd century BCE)  was a queen of the Seleucid Empire by marriage to Demetrius II Nicator. She was the daughter of the Parthian king Mithridates I (171 BCE-132 BCE), and sister of Phraates II (ruled 132 BCE-127 BCE).\n\nLife\n\nIn 138 BCE Rhodogune married Seleucid King Demetrius II Nicator (ruled 146-139 BCE, 129-126 BCE). They were kept by her brother in Hyrcania on the shores of the Caspian Sea, during which time they had several children. During their marriage, Demetrius was temporarily a hostage in the Parthian court after an ill-fated campaign in Babylonia.\n\nPolyaenus wrote that Rhodogune, informed of a revolt while preparing for a bath, vowed not to bathe or brush her hair until the revolt was quashed. She immediately went into battle, riding out to the head of her army. She defeated the rebels, and was depicted thereafter on seals of the kings of Persia with long, disheveled hair because of her adherence to her vow. This incident is also mentioned in the anonymously written Tractatus de mulieribus, which elaborates further on the story, describing her as being depicted with a golden statue showing her hair half-braided, half unbraided.\n\nShe was presumably abandoned in 129 BCE when Demetrius, after numerous failed attempts to escape from Parthia, was dispatched back to Antioch during the invasion of Parthia by Demetrius's brother, Antiochus VII Sidetes.\n\nReferences\n\nSources \n \n\n2nd-century BC births\n2nd-century BC Iranian people\n2nd-century BC women\nSeleucid royal consorts\nParthian princesses\nWomen in ancient Near Eastern warfare\nYear of death unknown",

After the war ended, Williamson officially signed for Arsenal, who had just been promoted to the First Division, for a \u00a3150 fee.

However, by this time his Arsenal place was under threat; after conceding fourteen goals first in five matches during 1922\u201323 he had been dropped in favour of Dunn, and later Jock Robson.

    "Thermal physics is the combined study of thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and kinetic theory of gases.  This umbrella-subject is typically designed for physics students and functions to provide a general introduction to each of three core heat-related subjects.  Other authors, however, define thermal physics loosely as a summation of only thermodynamics and statistical mechanics.\nThermal physics can be seen as the study of system with larger number  of atom,  it unites thermodynamics to statistical mechanics.\n\nOverview\nThermal physics, generally speaking, is the study of the statistical nature of physical systems from an energetic perspective.  Starting with the basics of heat and temperature, thermal physics analyzes the first law of thermodynamics and second law of thermodynamics from the statistical perspective, in terms of the number of microstates corresponding to a given macrostate.  In addition, the concept of entropy is studied via quantum theory.\n\nA central topic in thermal physics is the canonical probability distribution.  The electromagnetic nature of photons and phonons are studied which show that the oscillations of electromagnetic fields and of crystal lattices have much in common.  Waves form a basis for both, provided one incorporates quantum theory.\n\nOther topics studied in thermal physics include: chemical potential, the quantum nature of an ideal gas, i.e. in terms of fermions and bosons, Bose\u2013Einstein condensation, Gibbs free energy, Helmholtz free energy, chemical equilibrium, phase equilibrium, the equipartition theorem, entropy at absolute zero, and transport processes as mean free path, viscosity, and conduction.\n\nSee also \n\nHeat transfer physics\nInformation theory\nPhilosophy of thermal and statistical physics\nThermodynamic instruments\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\nThermal Physics Links on the Web\n\nPhysics education\nThermodynamics",

    "Crest Audio, Inc is an American company that produces professional sound equipment, including audio mixers, power amplifiers, and loudspeakers. Crest Audio was founded in the late 1970s by Jean-Pierre Prideaux in California. Dallas Music Industries (DMI) acquired Crest Audio in the 1980s and subsequently, Crest Audio was acquired by Peavey Electronics in 1999, and has since been based in Meridian, Mississippi. The company has an international network of distributors.\n\nHistory\nThe company was founded in the late 1970s by Jean-Pierre (John) Prideaux to build power amplifiers for the tour sound industry. The first amplifier, the P3500, delivered 475 watts-per-channel in a chassis that occupied a two-rack space at a time when competitors were offering 400 watts in a four-rack space. In 1983, the 4001 amplifier was the first to provide two-ohms in a three-rack space chassis. Four years later the 8001 power amplifier became an industry standard concert sound amplifier. It was superseded by the 8002 model in 1998.\n\nIn 1989, Crest audio diversified into mixing consoles with its Gamble EX series. Two years later the company introduced NexSys, a computer-based network amplifier control system that became the basis of a range that addresses every aspect of installation configuration and control.\n\nReferences\n\nAudio mixing console manufacturers\nAudio amplifier manufacturers\nLoudspeaker manufacturers\nAudio equipment manufacturers of the United States",

    "The Fucking Cunts Treat Us Like Pricks is an album by English anarcho-punk band Flux of Pink Indians. It was released as a double album on the band's own Spiderleg Records in 1984 as the follow-up to their debut, Strive to Survive Causing Least Suffering Possible.\n\nThe album was banned by several major retailers including HMV due to its sexually explicit title and cover art. Under the direction of James Anderton copies were seized, along with other records by Crass and Dead Kennedys, by Greater Manchester Police from Eastern Bloc record shop, who were charged with displaying \"Obscene Articles For Publication For Gain\". The album's lyrical content concerned violence between men and women, based on the experiences of a band member who had been sexually assaulted. The title was a Dada-style ploy to get attention for this social message. The band, its two record labels and its publishing company were also charged under the Obscene Publications Act, but all charges were dropped.\n\nThe album also featured artwork by Crass guitarist Andy Palmer.\n\nThe Fucking Cunts... reached number two on the UK Indie Chart, spending fifteen weeks on the chart in total.

It is managed by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of French Guiana (CCI Guyane).\n\nAir Guyane Express has its headquarters on the airport property.\n\nHistory \nThe first airfield at Cayenne, called \"Gallion,\" was built in 1943 in ten months by the U.S. Army Air Corps as a base allowing bombers to reach Africa. Though quickly abandoned upon the completion of the new airport, it can still be found very close to the aerodrome.\n\nThe new airport was first given the name \"Rochambeau\" in reference to Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau, commander-in-chief of the French troops in the American Revolutionary War. It was purchased by France in 1949.\n\nThis name was controversial because the airport's namesake's son, Donatien-Marie-Joseph de Vimeur, vicomte de Rochambeau, harshly repressed the Haitian Revolution during the Saint-Domingue expedition. Christiane Taubira, then-Member of the National Assembly of France for Guiana, requested in 1999 that the name be changed. Multiple proposals were submitted, including C\u00e9p\u00e9rou, a seventeenth-century indigenous chief. It was finally renamed F\u00e9lix \u00c9bou\u00e9 Airport in 2012, the change becoming official in January of that year.

When all other members of the Justiniani family died in the Aegean Sea, near Chios, during a Venetian military expedition in 1172, the government sent Baron Morosin and Toma Falier as delegates to Pope Alexander III, with the request to dispense Nicholas from his monastic vows.  This was granted, and Nicholas married Anna, the daughter of Doge Michieli.  Through this marriage, he founded five new lines of the Justiniani family. Shortly after 1179, he returned to the monastery.  His wife took the veil at a women's convent, which they had founded, on the Island of Aniano.

A week before the tournament, he had scored a memorable 102 against Pakistan Zone A. There, he had put on 135 for the second wicket with the skipper Gazi Ashraf Hossain. Against a stronger zone C side, he had scored 50, sharing a century opening stand with the veteran Raqibul Hasan.\n\nHis best performance came in the 1990 ICC Trophy in Netherlands.

The higher the mass measurements, the more likely the documents are to be equivalent to spam.\n\nThresholds \nA threshold value is used to identify groups of documents as spam.  If their relative mass value exceeds the threshold, the documents are considered to be spam.  A second threshold for the PageRank values of the selected documents is applied.

    "Verysdale is a part of medieval England which is mentioned in the early ballads of Robin Hood (especially the ballad A Gest of Robyn Hode, in which a friendly knight, Richard at the Lee, befriends the gallant outlaw and later is revealed as the lord or Earl of Verysdale). Verysdale may be entirely fictional, or it may be based upon a real county with some basis in geographical reality, or it may even have been a term used to refer to a real county. Scholars and historians are divided as to this, as well as the exact supposed location of Verysdale.\n\nSome believe the location of Verysdale was somewhere in the Peak District (the ballad would seem to suggest so), although there are many suggestions and theories. Locations in West Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Lancashire, and Cumbria have all been suggested. One scholar equated Verysdale with Wensleydale whilst another equated it with Kirklees.\n\nAlso mentioned in the same ballad was \"Uterysdale\", which has been identified by some as relating to the village of Lee in the Wyre valley - Wyresdale (Lancashire) and references to Richard de Leghs [Leghe] in Lancashire to one in the village of Woodhouses (since 1974 in Greater Manchester) during the early 13th century.

    "Yishtabach () (Hebrew: \"[ God ] be praised\") is a prayer in the final portion of the Pesukei Dezimra morning prayers of Judaism known as shacharit, recited before the second kaddish leading to the Shema prayers. \n\nThe theme of the number \"fifteen\" plays a pivotal role in the blessing; there are fifteen expressions conveying praise in the beginning half of the paragraph and fifteen words in the concluding blessing (after \"Blessed are You, God...\"). The number fifteen is an allusion both to the Divine Name \u05d9\u05d4 (whose gematria is fifteen) and to the fifteen Songs of Ascents composed by King David (Psalms 120\u201334).\n\nThere are two themes of Yishtabach: God's power and might are deserving of our praise and adoration, and that one must continually praise God.\n\nSince Baruch Sheamar and Yishtabach are both blessings, this gives the sense that Pesukei Dezimra is one single prayer. Yishtabach is not recited unless Baruch Sheamar is recited, because Baruch Sheamar is the opening blessing, and Yishtabach is the closing blessing.\n\nYishtabach is normally recited while standing. This is because Baruch Sheamar is recited while standing, and since Baruch Sheamar is the opening of Pesukei Dezimra and Yishtabach is the conclusion, they are both recited in the same manner. However, on Shabbat, some congregations have a custom to sit.\n\nThe author of Yishtabach is not known to this day. But with words 2\u20135 in the prayer spelling \u05e9\u05c1\u05dc\u05de\u05d4 (Shlomo), this alludes to a reference to King Solomon.\n\nText of Yishtabach\n\nReferences\n\nPesukei dezimra\nHebrew words and phrases in Jewish prayers and blessings\nSiddurim of Orthodox Judaism",

The band sarcastically suggested that the high obtained from sniffing Carbona cleaning solvent (carbon tetrachloride) was more pleasurable than that of airplane glue. In the hardcover book included in some versions of Hey! Ho! Let's Go: The Anthology, Tommy Ramone says, \"Something like 'Carbona Not Glue' has to be tongue-in-cheek. It's absurd, like saying that you should try something more poisonous.\" It was featured prominently in the graphic novel Ghost World by Dan Clowes.\n\nControversy\nThe original release of Leave Home included \"Carbona Not Glue\" as the fifth track on the album. However, the song was deleted from the album to avoid a potential lawsuit, as Carbona was a corporate trademark.

On the British version, \"Babysitter\" is not listed on the back cover or inner sleeve, but it is listed on the label. Most collectors believe that the \"Babysitter\" version is rarer than the \"Carbona\" version.\n\nWhen Sire Records suddenly switched distributors from ABC Records to Warner Bros.

    "The Eye in the Door is a novel by Pat Barker, first published in 1993, and forming the second part of the Regeneration trilogy.\n\nThe Eye in the Door is set in London, beginning in mid-April 1918, and continues the interwoven stories of Dr William Rivers, Billy Prior, and Siegfried Sassoon begun in Regeneration. It ends some time before the conclusion of the First World War later the same year. The third part of the trilogy, The Ghost Road, continues the story.\n\nWhereas Regeneration is an anomalous, but not unique, mixture of fact and fiction, The Eye in the Door acknowledges real events, including the campaign against homosexuals being waged that year by right-wing MP Noel Pemberton Billing, and the conviction of activist Alice Wheeldon for attempted assassination of Prime Minister  David Lloyd George, here subsumed with the character named Beatrice Roper, but the whole remains consistently within the realm of fiction. This grants Barker more freedom to explore her characters and their actions, the descriptions of which might be considered libellous if attributed to real people. A major theme of the book, Prior's intense and indiscriminate bisexuality, is effectively contrasted with Rivers's tepid asexuality and Sassoon's pure homosexuality.

    "Perizoma flavofasciata, the sandy carpet or sandy rivulet, is a moth of the family Geometridae. The species was first described by Carl Peter Thunberg in 1792. It is found in most of Europe and northern Africa and east across the Palearctic to the Urals and the Altai Mountains. The species prefers meadow valleys, floodplains, waterside areas, bushy meadows and gardens. In the Alps it rises to 1500 metres.\n\nDescription\nIts wingspan is 26\u201332\u00a0mm. The forewing is brownish-yellow or sandy with three toothed white transverse bands. The innermost is close to the base and rather narrow, the two outermost are wider and double (with a yellow-brown stripe in the middle). the outer white band is interrupted in the middle. Otherwise, the wings have several thin white transverse stripes, more or less complete, but the brownish-yellow ground colour predominates. The hind wing is white. The larva is pale pink with dark pink longitudinal stripes on either side of the dorsum. The area between the two longitudinal stripes is white. See also Prout.\n\nBiology\nThe larvae of sandy carpet moths live in flowers and capsules of carnations (family Caryophyllaceae); in particular they feed on the seed pods of various campions (Silene species).\n \nThe flight period is from late May to early August. It is scarce and overwinters as a pupa.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nFauna Europaea\nButterflies and Moths of Northern Ireland\n\nPerizoma\nMoths described in 1792\nMoths of Africa\nMoths of Europe\nMoths of Asia\nTaxa named by Carl Peter Thunberg",

    "Wei (), known in historiography as Zhai Wei (), was a dynastic state of China ruled by the Dingling people that existed from 388 to 392, during the Sixteen Kingdoms period of Chinese history. Its founder Zhai Liao had previously been vacillating between being a vassal of the Later Yan, Western Yan, and Eastern Jin dynasties, and in 388, after his last overture to reconcile with Later Yan's emperor Murong Chui was rejected, he founded his own dynasty, over the territory of modern central and eastern Henan. In 392, Zhai Wei, then under Zhai Liao's son Zhai Zhao, was destroyed by Later Yan forces.

    "The Giant Viper was a trailer-mounted, vehicle-pulled, mine clearance system, designed to be deployed in areas containing land mines. It was developed for the British Army in the 1950s. It was designed to be towed behind a Centurion gun tank, FV4003, AVRE (Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers); and also the FV432 Armoured personnel carrier.\n\nThe Giant Viper used rockets to launch a 250-metre-long hose, packed with plastic explosive, across a minefield. In the 1970s, the Giant Viper hoses were filled at ROF Chorley. Once it lands the charge is detonated, clearing a six-metre-wide path of anti-personnel and anti-tank mines by sympathetic detonation. This cleared path has a length of around 200 metres. For safety, a vehicle fitted with a mine plough is driven through the cleared path before any other personnel, in order to push any undetonated mines safely out of the way.\n\nThis system has been superseded by the Python Minefield Breaching System, employing the same methodology, but using more modern components. It improves accuracy of delivery, deployment speed, and the size of the cleared path, which is now 230 metres long and 7\u00a0meters wide. Python was designed to be towed behind an AVRE.\n\nThe Hellenic Army's Engineer Corps still utilize the system.\n\nSee also\n Mine-clearing line charge\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n \n \n\nMilitary engineering vehicles of the United Kingdom\nMine warfare countermeasures\nMilitary equipment introduced in the 1950s",

For example, its stylized Q is based on qoppa, an ancient form of Q. The O with a cross () is an early form of theta.\n\nIt is an all-capital font, but with different capital glyphs for both lowercase and capital letters. However, the only letter that has visually distinct forms is T, with the lowercase t being a cross.\n\nVariants\n\nIt is available in \"light\" and \"heavy\" varieties.

    "Idle animations are animations within video games that occur when the player character is not performing any actions. They serve to give games personality, as an Easter Egg for the player, or for realism.\n\nHistory \nOne of the earliest games to feature an idle animation was Android Nim in 1978. The androids blink, look around, and seemingly talk to one another until the player gives an order. Another two early examples are Maziacs and The Pharaoh's Curse released in 1983. Idle animations grew in usage throughout the 16 bit era. Incorporating idle animations was done to give personality towards games and their characters  as they are the only in-game actions aside from cutscenes where the characters are free to act independent of the player's input.  The idle animation length and details can depend on interaction between the player and character, such as third person player idle animations are longer to avoid looking robotic on repeated viewing. \u00a0In modern 3D games idle animation are done to give realism. For games targeting towards younger audiences the idle animations are more likely to be complex or humorous. In comparison games targeted towards older audiences tend to include more basic idle animations.\n\nExamples \n\n Maziacs - The sprite character will tap his feet, blink, and sit down.\n Sonic the Hedgehog - Sonic will impatiently tap his foot when the player does not move.\n Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy Kong's Quest - Diddy Kong juggles a few balls after a few seconds without input.\n Super Mario 64 - Mario looks around and eventually will fall asleep.\n Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas - Carl \"CJ\" Johnson will sing songs including \"Nuthin' But A'G' Thang\" and \"My Lovin' (You're Never Gonna Get It).\"\n Red Dead Redemption 2 - When left on a horse for a while Arthur Morgan will pet the horse.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Idle animations at Giant Bomb, games with idle animations\n\nVideo game development\nAnimation techniques",

    "Krakus, Krak or Grakch was a legendary Polish prince, ruler of the Vistulans (a Lechitic tribe), and the presumed founder of Krak\u00f3w. Krakus is also credited with building Wawel Castle and slaying the Wawel Dragon by feeding it a dead sheep full of sulfur. The latter is how Krak the cobbler became Krakus the prince, and later king. The first recorded mention of Krakus, then spelled Grakch, is in the Chronica seu originale regum et principum Poloniae from 1190.\n\nHistorian J. Banaszkiewicz attributes Krak's name to a pre-Slavic word \"krakula\", meaning 'judge's staff' or 'scepter', which also signified judicial authority among the pagan Balts. Historians Cetwi\u0144ski and Derwich suggest a different etymology, which seems more probable to some, with Krak, meaning simply an oak, a sacred tree, most often associated with the concept of genealogy. Moreover, the name of the city of Krak\u00f3w is believed to be derived from the word , which translates to 'crow' or 'raven'.\n\nKrakus Mound, which exists to this day, was previously believed to contain Krakus' remains. It has been the subject of thorough archeological research from 1934\u201338, however, no grave has ever been found in it. The mound has a diameter of over 50 meters.

    "The Symphony on a French Mountain Air (), Op. 25, is written in 1886 by Vincent d'Indy.\n\nAs indicated by the title, d'Indy took the principal theme from a folk song he heard at P\u00e9rier overlooking the C\u00e9vennes mountains (hence the work's alternative name, Symphonie c\u00e9venole).  Originally conceived as a fantaisie for piano and orchestra, the symphony is unusual in that it is scored for a prominent (but never dominant) piano part together with orchestra, and has acquired the label sinfonia concertante from some critics.\n\nIt consists of three movements and lasts just under half an hour:\nAssez lent - Mod\u00e9r\u00e9ment anim\u00e9\nAssez mod\u00e9r\u00e9, mais sans lenteur\nAnim\u00e9\nThe symphony begins with an evocative melody played first by a cor anglais.  The main themes of subsequent movements are based on this melody, and as the symphony progresses each subsequent variation becomes more and more like the original version.\n\nThe work was dedicated to Marie-L\u00e9ontine Bordes-P\u00e8ne, who was the soloist at the premiere in Paris on March 20, 1887.\n\nDiscography\n\n 1950 \u2013 Prague Radio Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Karel \u0160ejna with H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Boschi, piano.\n 1959 \u2013 Boston Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Charles Munch with Nicole Henriot-Schweitzer, piano.\n 1976 \u2013 Orchestre de Paris, conducted by Serge Baudo with Aldo Ciccolini, piano.\n 1977 \u2013 Budapest Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Tam\u00e1s P\u00e1l with Gabriella Torma, piano.\n 1991 - Orchestre Symphonique de Montr\u00e9al, conducted by Charles Dutoit with Jean-Yves Thibaudet, piano.\n 1992 \u2013 Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France, conducted by Marek Janowski with Catherine Collard, piano.\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\nDeruchie, Andrew. 2013.

    "A jugular foramen is one of the two (left and right) large foramina (openings) in the base of the skull, located behind the carotid canal. It is formed by the temporal bone and the occipital bone. It allows many structures to pass, including the inferior petrosal sinus, three cranial nerves, the sigmoid sinus, and meningeal arteries.\n\nStructure \nThe jugular foramen is formed in front by the petrous portion of the temporal bone, and behind by the occipital bone. It is generally slightly larger on the right side than on the left side.\n\nContents \nThe jugular foramen may be subdivided into three compartments, each with their own contents.\n\n The anterior compartment transmits the inferior petrosal sinus.\n The intermediate compartment transmits the glossopharyngeal nerve, the vagus nerve, and the accessory nerve.\n The posterior compartment transmits the sigmoid sinus (becoming the internal jugular vein), and some meningeal branches from the occipital artery and ascending pharyngeal artery.\n\nAn alternative imaging based subclassification exists, delineated by the jugular spine which is a bony ridge partially separating the jugular foramen into two parts:\n The smaller, anteromedial, \"pars nervosa\" compartment contains CN IX, (tympanic nerve, a branch of CN IX), and receives the venous return from inferior petrosal sinus.\n The larger, posterolateral, \"pars vascularis\" compartment contains CN X, CN XI, Arnold's nerve (or the auricular branch of CN X involved in the Arnold's reflex, where external auditory meatus stimulation causes cough), jugular bulb, and posterior meningeal branch of ascending pharyngeal artery.\n\nClinical significance \nObstruction of the jugular foramen can result in jugular foramen syndrome.\n\nAdditional images\n\nSee also \n Occipitomastoid suture\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\n \n \n  (, )\n \n UCSD\n\nForamina of the skull",
    "The Caf\u00e9 Wars took place during the Algerian War, as a part of the internal fighting in France between two rival Algerian nationalist movements, the Mouvement National Alg\u00e9rien and the Front de Lib\u00e9ration National (which later became the ruling political party in independent Algeria).\n\nThe Caf\u00e9 Wars are so called because part of the fighting took the form of bomb attacks and assassinations in caf\u00e9s, directed at supporters of the other party, as they struggled for control and influence over the large Algerian expatriate community and its organizations. Since both organizations operated underground, and were wanted by the French government, the line between a military and a civilian target was hard to draw, and often wilfully disregarded by the combatants. Groups from both the MNA and the FLN resorted to gangland-style killings, intimidation and the murder of civilians to pursue their political goals and secure finances and influence. This led to the Caf\u00e9 Wars being portrayed in France as acts of random terrorism, and conflated with attacks on French settlers in Algeria.\n\nAccording to some estimates the Caf\u00e9 Wars cost an estimated 5,000 lives. The official French figures are 3,975 dead and a total of 10,223 victims (dead or wounded).\n\nThe Caf\u00e9 Wars did not end before Algeria was granted independence in 1962, by the government of Charles de Gaulle. The FLN had by then routed the MNA's guerrilla units in Algeria, and for all practical purposes destroyed its organization in France.\n\nSee also \nZohra Drif\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nWar in the 18th Arrondissement - article by Francis Fytton in the London Magazine, December 1961.\n\nAlgerian War",

    "Gigantiform cementoma is a rare, autosomal dental tumor.  It is benign, but without intervention it can result in severe disfigurement of the jaw.  The cause of this tumor is currently unknown. This is an exceedingly rare tumor with only a handful of documented cases worldwide. The most famous case is of Novemthree Siahaan (who died on September 15, 2005), a young Indonesian boy from Batam Island who received medical care in Haulien, Taiwan through a Buddhist missionary from the Tzu Chi Foundation, which was documented on the Discovery Health Channel. Another famous case is a young Korean girl named Ayun Lee (August 26, 2003~) and her father Young-hak Lee whose case has shown that the tumor can be heritable. She is currently under treatment, which she may need to continue until her growth stops in her early 20s. \n\nThe term has been used in the past to describe florid cemento-osseous dysplasia, but it is now reserved for an autosomal dominant condition affecting the maxillae. It affects mostly Caucasian people under the age of 10. Treatment is difficult. Surgical removal of the affected bone is needed, and has to be followed by reconstruction.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\nRare cancers",

It has sandy soil, many farms, and is surrounded by the boreal forest. This Whitemouth River area is very close to the western edge of the Canadian Shield, and just north of the United States border.\n\nThe first settlements in the Hadashville area are believed to have been established about 1904. At that time, settlers received supplies from the nearest railway station near Whitemouth. The hamlet of Hadashville is named after Charles Hadash, who moved his family to the area after learning that a railway for the Greater Winnipeg Water District's (GWWD) Shoal Lake Aqueduct was planned. Hadash established the first post office in Hadashville along with a small store, pool room, and dance hall.\n\nReferences \n \"TimeLinks: Settler and Wife Clearing Land, Hadashville,\" Manitoba Historical Society\n Geographic Names of Manitoba published by The Millennium Bureau of Canada\n\nUnincorporated communities in Eastman Region, Manitoba",

    "Tire load sensitivity describes the behaviour of tires under load. Conventional pneumatic tires do not behave as classical friction theory would suggest. The load sensitivity of most real tires in their typical operating range is such that the coefficient of friction decreases as the vertical load, Fz, increases. The maximum lateral force that can be developed does increase as the vertical load increases, but at a diminishing rate.\n\nBehaviour\nCoulomb friction theory says that the maximum horizontal force developed should be proportional to the vertical load on the tire. In practice, the maximum horizontal force Fy that can be generated is proportional, roughly, to the vertical load Fz raised to the power of somewhere between 0.7 and 0.9, typically.  \n\nProduction car tires typically develop this maximum lateral force, or cornering force, at a slip angle of 6-10 degrees, although this angle increases as the vertical load on the tire increases.  Formula 1 car tires may reach a peak side force at 3 degrees\n\nExample\n\nAs an example, here is data extracted from Milliken and Milliken's \"Race Car Vehicle Dynamics\", figure 2.9:\n\nThe same sensitivity is typically seen in the longitudinal forces, and combined lateral and longitudinal slip.\n\nSee also\nRacing slick\nWeight transfer and load transfer\n\nReferences\n\nTires\nMotorcycle dynamics",

    "radio SHARK (the capitalization is a trademarked logotype) is a computer-controlled radio designed by Griffin Technology, introduced in late 2004. A second generation (radio SHARK 2) superseded it in 2007; they are distinguishable by color (the first model is white, the second is black). The radio connects the computer through a USB interface, which also supplies power to the radio.  The device is shaped like a shark fin, which includes four internal LED lights attached to three pieces of clear plastic on each side of the device's case, two LEDs of which glow blue when plugged in, the other two of which glow red when recording radio.\n\nSoftware designed for radio SHARK allows users to record radio programs at specific times and frequencies. The software also facilitates listening of \"live\" radio using time-shifting technology. Using the time-shifting features of the software, users can pause, rewind, and fast-forward \"live\" radio, in a manner similar to how users of TiVo or other digital video recorders can time-shift video. The radio SHARK uses the computer's hard drive to store audio files that allow for the time-shifting functionality. \n\nThe radio SHARK tunes in (Standard mode) 87.5 through 108.0 MHz FM, (Japanese mode) 76.0 through 90.0 MHz FM, and 522 through 1710 kHz AM. radio SHARK can tune both odd and even increments of FM frequencies, and either 9 or 10 kHz increments on AM.  \n\nCurrently, radio SHARK is compatible with both Macintosh and Microsoft Windows. The Macintosh version of the radio SHARK software can load recorded audio files directly into iTunes, facilitating easy transfer of recorded radio programs to an iPod or CD. The product has now been discontinued by the manufacturer, who also says, \"We do not support the use of this product in Lion, Mac OS 10.7 and later.\"\n\nExternal links\nradio Shark - official site\nradio Shark 2 - official site\nMacworld review\nArs Technica review\niLounge review of version 2\n\nComputer peripherals",

    "The tro Khmer () is a traditional bowed string instrument from Cambodia.  Its body is made from a special type of coconut covered on one end with snake skin, and it has three strings. Instruments are not standardized, and coconuts vary in size; however the instrument's sound bowl may have dimensions 16.5\u00a0cm by 14\u00a0cm. In the past the strings were made of silk. By the 1960s, metal strings were in use, and the sound of the instrument changed, becoming sharper.\n\nThe tro Khmer is closely related to a Thai instrument called saw sam sai.\n\nThe instrument may be related to the similarly shaped Indonesian version of the rebab, arriving there from Muslim culture, c. 15th century a.d.

At that time Naseerabad, Jhal Magsi and Jafarabad districts were included, these were separated in 1987.\nIt is driven, like a wedge, into the frontier mountain system and extends for 150 miles from Jacobabad to Sibi, with nearly as great a breadth at its base on the Sindh frontier. The soil is fertile wherever it can be irrigated by the floods brought down from the surrounding hills; but much of the central portion is sandy waste.

Janjalani was also allegedly given $6 million by Osama bin Laden to establish the organization as an offshoot of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF). Janjalani had allegedly met Bin Laden in Afghanistan in the late 1980s and allegedly fought alongside him against the Soviet Union during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.

Daggertooth pike congers occur in the Red Sea, on the coast of the northern Indian Ocean, and in the West Pacific from Indochina to Japan. A single specimen was also reported in the Mediterranean Sea off Israel in 1982.\n\nCulinary uses \n\nDaggertooth pike conger is a major commercial species, with annual catches reaching about 350,000 tonnes in recent years. The spot reporting the largest landings was Taiwan. It is eaten in Japanese cuisine, where it is known as hamo (\u30cf\u30e2, \u9c67). In the Kansai Region, hamo no kawa (pickled conger skins) is a traditional delicacy, and pike conger is a common ingredient in some types of kamaboko (fish cake).\n\nParasites \n\nAs with other fish, the daggertooth pike conger harbours several species of parasites. \n\nA species of trichosomoidid nematode which parasitizes the muscles of the fish off Japan has been described in 2014 and named Huffmanela hamo, in reference to the Japanese name of the fish.

Holzer remained in Augusta for two summers, where due to the combination of her small stature, almost frightening work ethic, and surprising speed on the water, she earned the nickname \"Pocket Rocket.\"  Kristine's rowing career peaked at the 1998 United States Senior National Team Trials, where she finished second in the women's double sculls.  After being snubbed for a spot as a spare in the 1998 World Rowing Championships, Kristine decided to take up speedskating at the age of 24 (despite having only skated once in her life).\n\nAfter narrowly missing a spot on the 2002 Winter Olympic squad, Holzer skated at the 2006 Winter Olympics and finished in 27th place in the 3000 meters.\n\nReferences \n US Speedskating profile\n\nExternal links \n NBC Olympics \n Kristine's U.S. Olympic Team bio \n Sports-Reference.com bio\n\nLiving people\n1974 births\nAmerican female speed skaters\nOlympic speed skaters for the United States\nSpeed skaters at the 2006 Winter Olympics\nCanadian people of German descent\nCanadian emigrants to the United States\nGonzaga University alumni\n21st-century American women",

    "A light-addressable potentiometric sensor (LAPS) is a sensor that uses light (e.g. LEDs) to select what will be measured. Light can activate carriers in semiconductors.\n\nHistory \n\nAn example is the pH-sensitive LAPS (range pH4 to pH10) that uses LEDs in combination with (semi-conducting) silicon and pH-sensitive Ta2O5 (SiO2; Si3N4) insulator. The LAPS has several advantages over other types of chemical sensors. The sensor surface is completely flat, no structures, wiring or passivation are required. At the same time, the \"light-addressability\" of the LAPS makes it possible to obtain a spatially resolved map of the distribution of the ion concentration in the specimen. The spatial resolution of the LAPS is an important factor and is determined by the beam size and the lateral diffusion of photocarries in the semiconductor substrate. By illuminating parts of the semiconductor surface, electron-hole pairs are generated and a photocurrent flows. The LAPS is a semiconductor based chemical sensor with an electrolyte-insulator-semiconductor (EIS) structure. Under a fixed bias voltage, the AC (kHz range) photocurrent signal varies depending on the solution.  A two-dimensional mapping of the surface from the LAPS is possible by using a scanning laser beam.\n\nOptoelectronics\nSensors",

    "An adverbial complement is an adverbial that is required to complete the meaning of a verb, such that if it is removed, it will yield an ungrammatical sentence or an intrinsically different meaning of the verb. They stand in contrast to adverbial adjuncts, which can be removed from a sentence without altering its structure or meaning.\n\nAdverbial complements often accompany verbs of caused motion such as put or place:\n\nShe put the cheese back.\n*She put the cheese.\nNow place the vase on the mantlepiece.\n*Now place the vase.\n\nHowever, they can occur with other types of verbs as well:\n\nWe are staying in a hotel.\n*We are staying.\n\nTheoretical approaches\nHead-driven phrase structure grammar describes adverbial complements as part of the verbs' subcategorization frame, which is why they are obligatory arguments. In this theory, adverbial complements are stored in the lexicon as part of the grammatical competence relating to the verb.\n\nAn alternative description, along the lines of construction grammar is that they are parts of certain argument structure constructions \u2013 in this case the caused motion construction \u2013 which are specifically compatible with the semantics of the verb. Here, adverbial complements are stored in the grammar as part of the caused motion construction which is a sign in its own right.\n\nAnother construction-based theory combines the two arguing that certain senses of verbs co-occur so frequently with certain argument structure constructions, that the argument structures are also stored as part of the grammatical competence relating to the verb. These small argument structure constructions are called mini-constructions. So, in the case of put, in accordance with this theory, adverbial complements are both part of the argument structure construction and stored as information regarding the verb itself.\n\nSee also\nAdjunct\nConjunct\nDisjunct\nEnglish grammar\n\nReferences\n\nGrammar",

They mainly live in five villages.\n\nLanguage\nCashibo people speak the Cashibo-Cacataibo language, a Western Panoan language which is written in the Latin script and taught in primary schools.\n\nHistory\nWhen first approached by missionaries in 1757, the Cashibo killed one of them and forced the rest to flee. They maintained hostile relations with neighboring tribes. They joined Juan Santos Atahualpa in 1744 in the destruction of missions. In 1870, Shetebo and Conibo people raided the Cashibo.\n\nUntil the 20th century, Cashibo avoided outside contact. In 1930, they numbered 4,000 but their population was reduced by diseases. Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar Odicio dominated the Cashibo from 1930 to 1940. Odicio was a Cashibo who had been kidnapped and raised by the Shipibo. He encouraged the tribe to open a road into their territory, which brought on non-native settlement and rapid acculturation, with devastating effects on the tribe.\n\nIn 1940, the Peru government offered the surviving Cashibos a reservation; however, they declined, wishing to remain in their own homeland.\n\nNotes\n\nExternal links\nCashibo art, National Museum of the American Indian\n\nIndigenous peoples in Peru\nIndigenous peoples of the Amazon",

    "Pud Pud in Weird World (also known simply as Pud Pud) is a computer game published by Ocean Software in 1985 for the ZX Spectrum. It was written by Jonathan Smith. Smith was paid \u00a31000 for Pud Pud by Ocean Software and was given a job at Ocean as a direct result of the game.\n\nPlot\n\nPud Pud is trapped in Weird World and needs to escape. He must explore Weird World looking for ten puddings and avoiding the deadly kiss of Mrs Pud Pud.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe player controls Pud Pud (who resembles a round pudding with wings or feet depending on whether he's walking or flying) and must explore the mazelike Weird World. Pud Pud has a limited amount of energy which needs to be topped up by eating certain creatures that live in Weird World although other creatures, which drain his energy if eaten, must be avoided. If Pud Pud runs out of energy he loses one of his three lives.\n\nMrs Pud Pud occasionally appears on the screen and is similar to Pud Pud, but white and wearing high heels. If she touches Pud Pud he loses a life instantly, regardless of his energy status although the player will receive a bonus score based on how much energy was remaining when Mrs Pud Pud delivered her kiss.\n\nPud Pud can obtain an extra life by collecting all ten hidden puddings.\n\nThe puddings are spread randomly throughout the maze with only one being in the maze at a time. When all ten are collected, Pud Pud can escape Weird World.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\n1985 video games\nMaze games\nOcean Software games\nZX Spectrum games\nZX Spectrum-only games\nSingle-player video games\nVideo games developed in the United Kingdom",

    "NAT Port Mapping Protocol (NAT-PMP) is a network protocol for establishing network address translation (NAT) settings and port forwarding configurations automatically without user effort. The protocol automatically determines the external IPv4 address of a NAT gateway, and provides means for an application to communicate the parameters for communication to peers. Apple introduced NAT-PMP in 2005 by as part of the Bonjour specification, as an alternative to the more common ISO Standard Internet Gateway Device Protocol implemented in many NAT routers. The protocol was published as an informational Request for Comments (RFC) by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in RFC 6886.\n\nNAT-PMP runs over the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and uses port number 5351.  It has no built-in authentication mechanisms because forwarding a port typically does not allow any activity that could not also be achieved using STUN methods. The benefit of NAT-PMP over STUN is that it does not require a STUN server and a NAT-PMP mapping has a known expiration time, allowing the application to avoid sending inefficient keep-alive packets.\n\nNAT-PMP is the predecessor to the Port Control Protocol (PCP).\n\nSee also \n Port Control Protocol (PCP)\n Internet Gateway Device Protocol (UPnP IGD)\n Universal Plug and Play (UPnP)\n NAT traversal\n STUN\n Zeroconf\n\nReferences \n\nApple Inc. services\nNetwork protocols\nNetwork address translation",

In the ninth year of Hoshea, \"the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes\", resettling large numbers of population. (2 Kings 17:6)  \n \nThe \"men\" from each of these five cities (\"national groups\" - NIV) made its own gods and set them up in the shrines of the land, mixing it with the worship of Jehovah. \"The men of Babylon made Succoth Benoth, the men of Cuthah made Nergal, the men of Hamath made Ashima, the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites ... Adrammelech and Anamelech.\" (2 Kings 17:30-31) The Bible says that these deities were idols, although the Samaritans were not punished because they worshipped the God of the Israelites as well. Like Ashima, the identity of Succoth-benoth is unknown. Hayim Tawil noted that B\u00e0nitu (Akkadian: \ud808\udc40\ud808\ude4c\ud808\udf08 Ba.ni.TUM, \"the creaturess\") was an epithet of Ishtar in Nineveh, and postulated the name \"Succoth-benoth\" was a Hebrew rendition of a Neo-Babylonian or Neo-Assyrian divine name meaning \"the image of B\u00e0nitu\".\n\nAccording to b. Sanhedrin, Succoth Benoth was a Hen; according to y. Avoda Zara, a Hen and her Chicks; thus associating this god with the astrological constellation Pleiades. According to commentators, either sukkot is a foreign word for \"hen\" and the phrase means \"hen of chicks\" or the entire phrase is a foreign word for \"hen\".

Although the trail is only  long and about  off the valley floor, this hike should not be attempted by beginning hikers due to the difficulty of the missing portions of the trail.

    "Martina of Rome, a patron saint of Rome, was martyred in 226, according to some authorities, more probably in 228, under the pontificate of Pope Urban I, according to others. Her feast day is January 30.\n\nBiography\nThe daughter of an ex-consul and orphaned at an early age, she was described as a noble and beautiful virgin. She so openly testified to her Christian faith that she could not escape the persecutions under Severus Alexander. Arrested and commanded to return to idolatry, she refused, whereupon she was subjected to various tortures and was finally beheaded.\n\nThese tortures according to her vita include being scourged. She was condemned to be devoured by wild beasts in the amphitheater but was miraculously untouched by them. She was then thrown onto a burning pyre, from which she also escaped unhurt, and was finally beheaded. Her hagiography asserts that some of her executioners also converted to Christianity and were themselves beheaded.\n\nVeneration\nOstia, at the mouth of the Tiber, was the scene of her martyrdom; but her body was transported to Rome, where a church near the Mamertine Prison, Santi Luca e Martina, was later dedicated in her honour.\n\nOn October 25, 1634, during restoration of the crypt, as was common at this time in Rome, buried remains were found by the painter Pietro da Cortona, president of the Accademia di San Luca, and were attributed to the martyred Saint Martina. No doubt it was hoped that this would precipitate an influx of funds to shelter the relics in a new church. Pope Urban VIII, who occupied the Holy See at that time, had the church repaired and, it would seem, composed the hymns which are sung at her office.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nCatholic Forum: St. Martina\nMartina at Lives of the Saints\n\nItalian Roman Catholic saints\n3rd-century Christian saints\n228 deaths\nYear of birth unknown\n3rd-century Romans\n3rd-century Roman women\nChristian martyrs\nVirgin martyrs",

Hepburn (1891 \u2013 16 July 1971) was a Scottish businessman, a joint founder, along with Herbert Ross, of the Hepburn and Ross whisky blending company, which was the first to blend the popular Red Hackle whisky (blended today by Lang Brothers).  The prosperity that Hepburn and Ross' enterprise brought Charles Hepburn allowed him to become a well known Glasgow patron of the arts, with him amassing a large collection of literature and books in particular.  He also collected various paintings, furniture, arms and armour, as well as oriental rugs.\n\nHe became a benefactor to the University of Glasgow, for which he was given an honorary doctorate in law in 1964.  He was also involved with the Glasgow Zoo (as was his colleague Herbert Ross), of which he became president.  He is widely credited for reviving the fortunes of the zoo in the late 1950s and early 1960s by renovating it and donating some of his own money to this end.\n\nHepburn died on 16 July 1971.  He bequeathed to Glasgow University a large number of books and manuscripts, some 300 in total, which are now held there as the Hepburn Bequest.  He also left a house to the university, which is now known as Hepburn House, and fittingly, given Hepburn's commitment to the arts, houses the university's History of Art Department.\n\nExternal links\nGlasgow University Library on Hepburn and his donations to the library\n\nScottish philanthropists\n20th-century Scottish businesspeople\nPeople associated with Glasgow\n1891 births\n1971 deaths\nScottish art collectors\nScottish book and manuscript collectors\nPeople associated with the University of Glasgow",

Gwardaman\u0121a is the home of St. Luke's Hospital, Malta's former general public hospital, and Villa Guardamangia, the former home of Queen Elizabeth II. It is also the location where the Rediffusion House is found.\n\nOverview \n\nAt Gwardaman\u0121a one can find the Villa Guardamangia, a large two-storey building, best known for its elaborate porch which is reached by a flight of steps from each side. The first has a convex configuration over which is a wide elliptical arch. Scroll corbels support the lintels of the sides, while a square-headed doorway is set in an elliptical arched recess. On top of the porch are a series of segmentally arched, louvred windows. Other features include semi-circular wrought iron balconies on each side of the porch, louvred windows and a 'remissa' doorway. The fa\u00e7ade lacks decoration, apart from a balustraded parapet wall.\n\nThe villa was leased by Lord Louis Mountbatten around 1929.  At various times between 1946 and 1953, Queen Elizabeth II stayed at the villa as both Princess and then Queen while her fianc\u00e9, and later husband, The Duke of Edinburgh was stationed in Malta as a serving Royal Navy officer.  Philip and Elizabeth lived in Malta for a period between 1949 and 1951, which made Malta the only foreign country in which the Queen ever resided.

Her second, Threads of Malice, was nominated for the 2006 Gaylactic Spectrum Awards.\n\nHer three books focus on a group of investigators in a society still recovering from a devastating ancient war, in the absence of many of the technologies it once enjoyed. The lead character, Dubric Byerly, is an aging noble, war veteran and widower who has responsibility for peace and security in Castle Faldorrah and its local villages. Along with his squire, Dien, and young assistant pages Lars and Otlee, Dubric solves crimes and enforces the law in Faldorrah.\n\nWhat makes Dubric so good at his job, but so miserable in his own life, is his secret curse \u2013 since his wife's brutal death, he sees the ghosts of people murdered within the scope of his responsibility, and is haunted by these spectres until their killers are brought to justice.\n\nThe three books are a combination of fantasy and thriller, with the driving force in the plot being a particular mystery or crime. They contain consistently dark themes but are often balanced with a dry black humor.\n\nTamara Siler Jones now writes under a semi-pseudonym, Tambo Jones.
