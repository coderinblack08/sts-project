"Leukopoiesis is a form of hematopoiesis in which white blood cells (WBC, or leukocytes) are formed in bone marrow located in bones in adults and hematopoietic organs in the fetus. White blood cells, indeed all blood cells, are formed from the differentiation of pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells which give rise to several cell lines with unlimited differentiation potential. These immediate cell lines, or colonies, are progenitors of red blood cells (erythrocytes), platelets (megakaryocytes), and the two main groups of WBCs, myelocytes and lymphocytes.

"Robert A. Wilson was an American gynecologist who is known for writing the best-selling 1966 book Feminine Forever. He is also known for his organization the Wilson Research Foundation (WRA). In Feminine Forever, Wilson promoted the use of estrogen therapy to avoid the menopause and associated symptoms. He characterized menopause as a serious disease state and made strong claims about the effectiveness and safety of menopausal hormone therapy in alleviating it and improving quality of life and health. Wilson's claims were criticized as not being based on adequate research and evidence. Subsequently, trials such as the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) contradicted Wilson's claims and showed that menopausal hormone therapy could have significant medical risks and that its benefits were not as great as once believed.

Wilson's early medical career was unremarkable, and he did not publish his first papers until 1962, when he was in his late 60s.

It was revealed by Wilson's son, Ronald Wilson, that Wyeth-Ayerst had secretly paid all of the fees for Wilson to write his book and also helped finance his foundation. Other pharmaceutical companies additionally funded the Wilson Research Foundation. Within 10 years of the publishing of his book, in which Wilson promoted the use of conjugated estrogens (Premarin) and of menopausal hormone therapy in general, Premarin became the fifth most-prescribed drug in the United States.

"The Eye in the Door is a novel by Pat Barker, first published in 1993, and forming the second part of the Regeneration trilogy.

The Eye in the Door is set in London, beginning in mid-April 1918, and continues the interwoven stories of Dr William Rivers, Billy Prior, and Siegfried Sassoon begun in Regeneration. It ends some time before the conclusion of the First World War later the same year. The third part of the trilogy, The Ghost Road, continues the story.

Whereas Regeneration is an anomalous, but not unique, mixture of fact and fiction, The Eye in the Door acknowledges real events, including the campaign against homosexuals being waged that year by right-wing MP Noel Pemberton Billing, and the conviction of activist Alice Wheeldon for attempted assassination of Prime Minister  David Lloyd George, here subsumed with the character named Beatrice Roper, but the whole remains consistently within the realm of fiction. This grants Barker more freedom to explore her characters and their actions, the descriptions of which might be considered libellous if attributed to real people. A major theme of the book, Prior's intense and indiscriminate bisexuality, is effectively contrasted with Rivers's tepid asexuality and Sassoon's pure homosexuality. Greater fictional scope also permits a deeper treatment of the psychological, political and professional life of the central character, Billy Prior.

"Princess Shi (; personal name unknown), who might have taken the title Empress Shi () at one point, was the wife of Lü Guang (Emperor Yiwu), the founder of the Di-led Later Liang dynasty of China.

Very little is known about her. What is known is that when Lü Guang, who was then a Former Qin general, was sent by the Former Qin emperor Fu Jiān in 383 on a mission to subdue the Xiyu (西域, modern Xinjiang and former Soviet Central Asia) kingdoms, she did not accompany her husband but remained in the Former Qin capital Chang'an with his son Lü Shao, who was probably her son as well.  

When Chang'an fell to Western Yan forces in 385, they fled to the semi-independent state Chouchi, and after Lü Guang established Later Liang after returning from his Xiyu mission and seizing Liang Province (涼州, modern central and western Gansu), they arrived in his capital Guzang (姑臧, in modern Wuwei, Gansu) in 389.  Lü Guang, who then carried the title Prince of Sanhe, created her his princess and created Lü Shao heir apparent.  

By the time he claimed the imperial title ""Heavenly Prince"" (Tian Wang) in 396 and created Lü Shao crown prince, she was not mentioned, implying that she might have died by that point, and there was no further reference to her in history.  If she had in fact survived to 396, she would have likely been created empress.  The table below assumes that she survived to 400 when Lü Guang died, but that was in fact not likely.

"Kunzea is a genus of plants in the family Myrtaceae and is endemic to Australasia.  They are shrubs, sometimes small trees and usually have small, crowded, rather aromatic leaves.  The flowers are similar to those of plants in the genus ""Leptospermum"" but differ in having stamens that are longer than the petals. Most kunzeas are endemic to Western Australia but are few occur in eastern Australia and a few are found in New Zealand.  The taxonomy of the genus is not settled and is complicated by the existence of a number of hybrids. Kunzea salina is a species of flowering plants in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae.  It was previously classified in the monotypic genus ""Angasomyrtus"" as ""Angasomyrtus salina"".  The name is still accepted by some authorities, while others accept its transfer into genus ""Kunzea"" as ""Kunzea salina"". Ricinus communis, the castorbean or castor-oil-plant, is a species of perennial flowering plant in the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae.  It is the sole species in the monotypic genus, Ricinus, and subtribe, Ricininae.  The evolution of castor and its relation to other species are currently being studied using modern genetic tools.

"Stereomud was an American nu metal band from New York City and Georgia. They were active from years 1999 to 2003 before breaking up, releasing two albums—Perfect Self and Every Given Moment.

History
Stereomud released their first album, Perfect Self, on Columbia Records in 2001 and a video for the song ""Pain"" received airplay on MTV2. After extensive touring in support of that album, they went back into the studio, releasing Every Given Moment in April 2003. After participating in the Jägermeister Music Tour with Hed PE, Breaking Benjamin, Systematic, and Saliva, Columbia Records cut their touring support, and dropped the band. Due to this, and an impending Life of Agony reunion, Stereomud went their separate ways in July 2003, a mere three months after the release of Every Given Moment. They have performed a few select reunion shows since this, but for the most part, the band remains dormant to this day. Recently, it was rumored that Erik Rogers and Corey Lowery would reunite to reform the band, but the possibilities may not be true as they are focusing on their own bands. It is planned that a Stereomud DVD will be released at some point in the future.

Erik Rogers – vocalist (later in Soundevice, Love Said No, Dangerous New Machine and My Therapy)

"Epigaea is a genus comprising three species of flowering plants in the Ericaceae.  The species are small creeping shrubs that are typically anywhere from 10 to tall at full growth, forming large patches.  The leaves are evergreen, alternate and simple, ranging amongst the three species from 2 to long.  The flowers are small, white or pink, with a five-lobed tubular corolla which is produced in mid-spring.  The fruit is a dry capsule with numerous small seeds. Aegopodium is a plant genus of the carrot family Apiaceae native to Europe and western Asia.  It is represented by about seven species, all are perennial herbs.  Flowers are compounded, umbels appearing in spring-summer and are visited by many types of insect pollinators.  Fruit consists of two-winged or ribbed nuts that separate on ripening. Aegopodium podagraria L. commonly called ground elder, herb gerard, bishop's weed, goutweed, gout wort, and snow-in-the-mountain, and sometimes called English masterwort, and wild masterwort, is a perennial plant in the carrot family (Apiaceae) that grows in shady places.  The name ""ground elder"" comes from the superficial similarity of its leaves and flowers to those of elder (""Sambucus""), which is unrelated.  It is the type species of the genus ""Aegopodium"".  This species is native to Eurasia, and has been introduced around the world as an ornamental plant, where it occasionally poses an ecological threat as an invasive exotic plant.","Answer the following question based on the context: Which plant has more species, Epigaea or Aegopodium?",

"Istor-o-Nal or इस्तोर-ओ-नल is the third highest mountain in the Hindu Kush, in the Chitral District of the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan.  It is the 68th highest independent peak in the world.  It crowns a massif with eleven peaks of elevation more than 7000 m .  The peak is located a few kilometres northeast of Tirich Mir (the highest mountain in the Hindu Kush), across the Tirich Glacier.  Because Istor-o-Nal is behind the higher peak of Tirich Mir from many viewpoints, it is not easily visible and therefore not well known.

"The Colbys is an American prime time television soap opera that originally aired on ABC from November 20, 1985, to March 26, 1987. Produced by Aaron Spelling, it was a spin-off of Dynasty, which had been the highest rated series for the 1984–1985 U.S. television season. The Colbys revolves around another vastly wealthy, upper-class family, who are relatives by marriage of the Carringtons of Dynasty and who own a large multinational conglomerate. It stars Charlton Heston as billionaire Jason Colby, Barbara Stanwyck as his sister Constance, Stephanie Beacham as Jason's wife Sable, and John James and Emma Samms as their Dynasty characters Jeff Colby and Fallon Carrington. Designed to be bigger than the original show, The Colbys was ultimately a ratings disappointment, and was cancelled after two seasons and 49 episodes.

"In propositional logic, biconditional introduction is a valid rule of inference. It allows for one to infer a biconditional from two conditional statements. The rule makes it possible to introduce a biconditional statement into a logical proof. If  is true, and if  is true, then one may infer that  is true. For example, from the statements ""if I'm breathing, then I'm alive"" and ""if I'm alive, then I'm breathing"", it can be inferred that ""I'm breathing if and only if I'm alive"". Biconditional introduction is the converse of biconditional elimination. The rule can be stated formally as:

where the rule is that wherever instances of """" and """" appear on lines of a proof, """" can validly be placed on a subsequent line.

Formal notation 
The biconditional introduction rule may be written in sequent notation:

where  is a metalogical symbol meaning that  is a syntactic consequence when  and  are both in a proof;

or as the statement of a truth-functional tautology or theorem of propositional logic:

"Telese Terme, called simply Telese until 1991, is a city, comune (municipality) and former episcopal seat in the Province of Benevento, in the Campania region of southern Italy. It is located in the valley of the Calore, well known for its sulfuric hot springs.

Etymology 
Telesia is an old word for the gem Sapphire.

History 
Telese was an ancient Samnite (Italic) city, known as T(h)elesia. The city was captured by Hannibal in 217 BCE; later, the victor Roman general Scipio Africanus founded a Roman colony there.

In 460 was established a Diocese of Telese / Thelesina (Latin adjective).

Having fallen into decay after the Gothic War it was conquered by the Longobards, becoming part of the Lombard Duchy of Benevento as seat of a gastaldry (district).

The city was destroyed in the years 847 and 860, by the Saracens, and again in the 11th century, during the war between King Roger II of Sicily and the Norman counts of the southern Italian mainland.

A new Telesia was built; however, it was again pulverized in 1349, this time by an earthquake.

Its former cathedral cattedrale Santa Croce, dedicated to the Holy Cross, now in ruins, was decommissioned after the bishops transferred their see to nearby Cerreto Sannita, yet the see retained the alternative title Diocese of Telese as well, even after a further merger into the Diocese of Cerreto Sannita–Telese–Sant’Agata de’ Goti.

In 1883, after the Unification of Italy, thermal baths were built, hence the current full name Telese Terme since 1991. Telese became an independent commune in 1934.

Main sights 
It possesses remains of walls in , of a total length of over a mile; two inscriptions of the Republican period record the erection of towers. The remains of baths () and of an amphitheatre still exist; the city was supplied with water by an aqueduct. There are sulphur springs in the vicinity, which may have supplied the baths.

"Small Computer System Interface (SCSI, ) is a set of standards for physically connecting and transferring data between computers and peripheral devices.  The SCSI standards define commands, protocols, electrical and optical interfaces.  SCSI is most commonly used for hard disk drives and tape drives, but it can connect a wide range of other devices, including scanners and CD drives, although not all controllers can handle all devices.  The SCSI standard defines command sets for specific peripheral device types; the presence of ""unknown"" as one of these types means that in theory it can be used as an interface to almost any device, but the standard is highly pragmatic and addressed toward commercial requirements. In computer storage, SAF-TE (abbreviated from SCSI Accessed Fault-Tolerant Enclosure) is an industry standard to interface an enclosure to a (parallel) SCSI subsystem to gain access to information or control for various elements and parameters.  These include temperature, fan status, slot status (populated/empty), door status, power supplies, alarms, and indicators (e.g. LEDs, LCDs).

"Krakus, Krak or Grakch was a legendary Polish prince, ruler of the Vistulans (a Lechitic tribe), and the presumed founder of Kraków. Krakus is also credited with building Wawel Castle and slaying the Wawel Dragon by feeding it a dead sheep full of sulfur. The latter is how Krak the cobbler became Krakus the prince, and later king. The first recorded mention of Krakus, then spelled Grakch, is in the Chronica seu originale regum et principum Poloniae from 1190.

Historian J. Banaszkiewicz attributes Krak's name to a pre-Slavic word ""krakula"", meaning 'judge's staff' or 'scepter', which also signified judicial authority among the pagan Balts. Historians Cetwiński and Derwich suggest a different etymology, which seems more probable to some, with Krak, meaning simply an oak, a sacred tree, most often associated with the concept of genealogy. Moreover, the name of the city of Kraków is believed to be derived from the word , which translates to 'crow' or 'raven'.

Krakus Mound, which exists to this day, was previously believed to contain Krakus' remains. It has been the subject of thorough archeological research from 1934–38, however, no grave has ever been found in it. The mound has a diameter of over 50 meters. According to research, it was erected between the 8th and 10th centuries as a central element of an ancient grave site, which does not exist today.

The Krak and Princess Wanda legend appeared in the early Polish history written by Wincenty Kadłubek (); a similar legend, that of Krok and Libussa, appeared in the early Czech history by Cosmas of Prague.

"GTE Midwest, Inc. was a GTE operating company formed in 1993 upon the split off of some GTE local telephone operations from GTE North. GTE Midwest served Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, and Minnesota, and included the former operations of Contel in Iowa and Missouri.

History
In 1995, GTE Midwest's Minnesota operations were transferred to Contel of Minnesota, Inc. Contel of Minnesota had always been a separate company from GTE Midwest. 

In 2000, GTE completed the sale of some of its Missouri lines to Spectra Communications Group, which was an investment of CenturyTel. Also occurring that year Bell Atlantic acquired GTE, renaming the merged company Verizon. Upon the completion of the merger, Iowa operations of GTE Midwest were sold to Iowa Network Service, and Nebraska operations were sold to Citizens Utilities (Citizens Telecommunications Company of Nebraska). By the end of 2000, GTE Midwest only served Missouri, and GTE Midwest began doing business as Verizon Midwest.

Dissolution
In 2002, Verizon sells its operations in Missouri to CenturyTel, becoming CenturyTel of Missouri (remaining separate from Spectra Communications Group). 

On August 31, 2002, Verizon discontinued Verizon Midwest as an operating company, with all of its operations transferred to different operating companies within former GTE operating, or the operations being sold off.

"Cola de mono or Colemono (literally, monkey's tail) is a traditional Chilean drink served around Christmas time.  It is similar to a White Russian.

Although there are many versions of this drink, it contains mainly aguardiente, milk, sugar, coffee, and cloves. A virgin version can be made simply without the alcohol.

Etymology

There are several theories surrounding the origin of the name. Since this drink is homemade, it was originally bottled in bottles whose labels were from the company Anís del Mono. Eventually the play on words of cola de mono was created.  The more accepted theory, however, is related to President Pedro Montt, nicknamed El Mono Montt, or Monkey Montt. During an evening party, Montt prepared to leave and asked for his revolver, a Colt. He was convinced to stay and continue on with the festivities. After all of the wine was drunk and the guests still thirsty for more, mixed milk, coffee, aguardiente, and sugar. Within time, the drink gained popularity and was dubbed ""Colt de Montt"", eventually morphing into ""Cola de Mono"" and later ""Colemono"", which is the name used in the ""RAE"" dictionaries and in common speech.

"Güneysu is a town in Rize Province in the Black Sea region of Turkey, inland from the city of Rize. It is the seat of Güneysu District. Its population is 8,722 (2021).

History
Güneysu was formerly named in Greek Potamya (Ποταμιὰ, ""river village"") and the name persists in local usage to this day, as Güneysu stands on a plain watered by the Potamya river, a tributary of the Taşlıdere (or Askoroz) river (the ancient and Byzantine Ἄσκουρος ποταμός).

Geography
This is a hilly district of rivers and valleys, inland from the Black Sea coast, with peaks inland as high as 2000 m. The climate is wet, hence the number of valleys that have been cut through by mountain streams. Thus, floods and landslides are a constant threat even today. The coastal vegetation is broad-leaved but the higher land is pine forest, with Alpine plants in the high meadows up in the Kaçkar Mountains. 

Güneysu is an impoverished rural district losing much of its population as they migrate to jobs elsewhere (some of Turkey's biggest construction firms have their roots here for example). The main source of income is growing tea and in recent years kiwifruit. Other crops are mainly grown in family gardens for personal use. The only industry is tea processing, and Güneysu is a centre of this for the Rize province.

Climate
Güneysu has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: Cfa).

Notable natives
The Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is from a Güneysu family, spent part of his childhood here, and still regularly visits the district.

"In organic chemistry, hydrocarbons (compounds composed solely of carbon and hydrogen) are divided into two classes: aromatic compounds and aliphatic compounds (; G. aleiphar, fat, oil). Aliphatic compounds can be saturated (in which all the C-C bonds are single requiring the structure to be completed, or 'saturated', by hydrogen) like hexane, or unsaturated, like hexene and hexyne. Open-chain compounds, whether straight or branched, and which contain no rings of any type, are always aliphatic. Cyclic compounds can be aliphatic if they are not aromatic.

Structure 

Aliphatic compounds can be saturated, joined by single bonds (alkanes), or unsaturated, with double bonds (alkenes) or triple bonds (alkynes). If other elements (heteroatoms) are bound to the carbon chain, the most common being oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and chlorine, it is no longer a hydrocarbon, and therefore no longer an aliphatic compound. However, such compounds may still be referred to as aliphatic if the hydrocarbon portion of the molecule is aliphatic, e.g. aliphatic amines, to differentiate them from aromatic amines.

The least complex aliphatic compound is methane (CH4).

Properties 

Most aliphatic compounds are flammable, allowing the use of hydrocarbons as fuel, such as methane in natural gas for stoves or heating; butane in torches and lighters; various aliphatic (as well as aromatic) hydrocarbons in liquid transportation fuels like petrol/gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel; and other uses such as ethyne (acetylene) in welding.

Examples of aliphatic compounds 
The most important aliphatic compounds are:

 n-, iso- and cyclo-alkanes (saturated hydrocarbons)
 n-, iso- and cyclo-alkenes and -alkynes (unsaturated hydrocarbons).

Important examples of low-molecular aliphatic compounds can be found in the list below (sorted by the number of carbon-atoms):

His father (Niels Nielsen) and grandfather (Niels Valdemarsen) had both held Halland as a county before him. Jacob received Halland in 1283, but switched allegiance to the King of Norway two years later and was declared an outlaw in 1287 after the murder of Eric V of Denmark.

In Halland, Jacob built the fortresses of Hunehals and later Varberg Fortress. Jacob's position weakened after the Norwegian king started to lose interest in the conflict with Denmark, and in 1305, he was forced to relinquish Halland to Haakon V of Norway, who granted it to his own son-in-law, the Swedish duke Erik Magnusson.

During a 2013 study of Amblyopsis spelaea, scientists found that the species was divided into two distinct evolutionary lineages: one north of the Ohio River, in Indiana, and one south of the river, in Kentucky.  The southern population retained the name A. spelaea and the northern was re-designated Amblyopsis hoosieri in a 2014 paper published in the journal ZooKeys. Neither species is found north of the White River, flowing east to west south of Bedford, Indiana.

"Area codes 631 and 934 are the telephone area codes in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) for Suffolk County, New York, on Long Island. Area code 631 was created in 1999 in a split from 516; and 934 was added as an overlay in 2016. Communities within the area include Babylon, Huntington, Islip, Smithtown, Brookhaven, Riverhead, Southampton, Southold, Shelter Island, and East Hampton.

History of Suffolk County area codes

1947–1951: 914
With the announcement of a new nationwide telephone numbering plan by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T) in October 1947, Suffolk County, Nassau County, the lower Hudson Valley, and some areas adjacent were assigned area code 914.

1951–1999: 516
During 1951, area code 516 was assigned to Suffolk and Nassau, which were separated thereby from area code 914.

1999–2016: 631
On November 1, 1999, area code 631 was created solely for Suffolk County, to satisfy the increased need for telephone numbers mainly due to cellular services, while Nassau County retained area code 516.  Permissive dialing for numbers in 516 across Long Island continued until the spring of 2000.

2016–present: 631/934 overlay
On July 16, 2016, area code 934 was assigned to overlay 631, which was nearing depletion of central office codes. This was the first overlay in an area in the state of New York outside New York City, and required ten-digit dialing for both area codes, effective June 18, 2016.

History
The history of Başmakçı goes back to the Hittite era, 1750-1200 BC. It then became a colony of the Phrygians of nearby Dinar. It was subsequently possessed by Lydians, Persians, Ancient Macedonians and Seleucids, the kings of Pergamon, Romans and then Byzantines.

Turkish tribes arrived in Anatolia in 1071, and one of these was the Başmakçı, who came through Azerbaijan, settling near Tarsus on the Mediterranean, where there is a village called Başmakçı still today, and then sometime between 1100 and 1200 moving west to settle in this district of Afyon that has been called Başmakçı ever since.

This part of Anatolia was subsequently controlled by the Germiyan dynasty, who gave the town as dowry when marrying their daughter to the Ottoman Sultan Bayezid I. Thus Başmakçı, a village of 47 families at the time, became an Ottoman land.

Başmakçı was badly damaged in an earthquake in August 1892 when 300 homes were destroyed. However, no one was killed, as it was harvest time and all were in the fields.

Başmakçı was not occupied during the Turkish War of Independence but many of its sons died in that war and World War I previous to it.

Başmakçı today
Başmakçı is well-established as the leading egg producing area in Turkey.

"Agapanthus is the only genus in the subfamily Agapanthoideae of the flowering plant family Amaryllidaceae.  The family is in the monocot order Asparagales.  The name is derived from scientific Greek: αγάπη (agape) = love, άνθος (anthos) = flower. Pterocephalus is a genus in the Caprifoliaceae family of herbs and shrubs, comprising 25 species ranging from the Mediterranean, to central Asia, the Himalayas, western China, and tropical Africa. Agapanthoideae is a subfamily of monocot flowering plants in the family Amaryllidaceae, order Asparagales.  It is one of three subfamilies of Amaryllidaceae.  It was formerly treated as a separate family, Agapanthaceae.  The subfamily name is derived from the generic name of the type genus, ""Agapanthus"". Agapanthus praecox (common agapanthus, blue lily, African lily, or lily of the Nile) is a popular garden plant around the world, especially in Mediterranean climates.  It is native of Natal and Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, local names include ""agapant"", ""bloulelie"", ""isicakathi"" and ""ubani"".  Most of the cultivated plants of the genus ""Agapanthus"" are hybrids or cultivars of this species.  The plant is reportedly naturalized in Great Britain, Madeira, the Canary Islands, Eritrea, Ethiopia, St. Helena, Victoria, Norfolk Island, New Zealand, Mexico, Honduras, Costa Rica and Tristan da Cunha. Agapanthus africanus (African lily) is a flowering plant from the genus ""Agapanthus"" native to the area of Cape of Good Hope in South Africa.

The work was initially called a ""ballet bouffon"", though it was later styled a ""comédie lyrique"", putting it in the same category as Rameau's ""Les Paladins"".  It was written for the celebrations of the wedding of Louis, Dauphin of France, son of King Louis XV of France, to the Infanta Maria Theresa of Spain, who, according to contemporary sources, like the title character was no beauty.  Instead of getting the composer into trouble, the entertainment at Versailles seems to have been well received, and Rameau was appointed a few months later to the position of Composer of the King's Chamber Music with a sizable annual pension.",Answer the following question based on the context:  Platée and La straniera are what?,

"The Kadowaki–Woods ratio is the ratio of A, the quadratic term of the resistivity and γ2, the linear term of the specific heat. This ratio is found to be a constant for transition metals, and for heavy-fermion compounds, although at different values.

In 1968 M. J. Rice pointed out that the coefficient A should vary predominantly as the square of the linear electronic specific heat coefficient γ; in particular he showed that the ratio A/γ2  is material independent for the pure 3d, 4d and 5d transition metals. Heavy-fermion compounds are characterized by very large values of A and γ. Kadowaki and Woods showed that A/γ2 is material-independent within the heavy-fermion compounds, and that it is about 25 times larger than in aforementioned transition metals.

According to the theory of electron-electron scattering the ratio A/γ2 contains indeed several non-universal factors, including the square of the strength of the effective electron-electron interaction. Since in general the interactions differ in nature from one group of materials to another, the same values of A/γ2 are only  expected within a particular group.  In 2005 Hussey proposed a re-scaling of A/γ2 to account for unit cell volume, dimensionality, carrier density and multi-band effects. In 2009 Jacko, Fjaerestad, and Powell demonstrated fdx(n)A/γ2 to have the same value in transition metals, heavy fermions, organics and oxides with A varying over 10 orders of magnitude, where fdx(n) may be written in terms of the dimensionality of the system, the electron density and, in layered systems, the interlayer spacing or the interlayer hopping integral.

"Saraghrar (Urdu: سراغرار‎ ) is the fourth highest independent peak in the Hindu Kush.  The entire Saraghrar massif is a huge, irregular stretched plateau at elevation around 7000 m , lying above vertical granite and ice faces, which protect it all around.

"The foreign relations of the Cayman Islands are largely managed from the United Kingdom, as the islands remains one of 14 overseas territories under British jurisdiction and sovereignty. However, the Government of the Cayman Islands have autonomy and often resolves important issues with foreign governments alone, without intervention from Britain. Although in its early days, the Cayman Islands' most important relationships were with Britain and Jamaica, in recent years, this has shifted, and they now rely more so on the United States and Canada.

Though the Cayman Islands are involved in no major international disputes, they have come under some criticism due to the use of their territory for narcotics trafficking and money laundering. In an attempt to address this, the Government entered into the Narcotics Agreement of 1984 and the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty of 1986 with the United States, in order to reduce the use of their facilities associated with these activities. In more recent years, they have stepped up the fight against money laundering, by limiting banking secrecy, introducing requirements for customer identification and record keeping, and requiring banks to cooperate with foreign investigators.

Due to their status as an overseas territory of the UK, the Cayman Islands have no representation either on the United Nations, or in most other international organizations. However, the Cayman Islands still participates in some international organisations, being a full member of the Central Development Bank and International Olympic Committee, an associate member of Caricom and UNESCO, and a member of a subbureau of Interpol.

Established in the 1950s as a base for mining non-ferrous metals, its mines are becoming exhausted in recent decades, requiring the city to reinvent its economy. Located around  from Gansu's capital Lanzhou, it is part of the Lanzhou-Baiyin Economic Belt.

Administration
Baiyin has 2 urban districts, 3 counties, 64 townships, 18 towns, and 7 sub-districts with a total population of 1,512,110 as of the 2020 Chinese census, of which 538,514 lived in the built-up (or metro) area made of the 2 urban districts of Baiyin and Pingchuan.

Economy
The Baiyin Nonferrous operates copper, zinc and selenium mines around Baiyin, although these mines are getting exhausted of ore. Financed by development funds, a high-tech park is being built, which is home to a contact lens factory. Pingchuan District and Huining County are the largest coal production bases in Gansu province.

The Yinguang Group, a subsidiary of Norinco, operates a major factory making chemicals for defense and civilian use, the factory was a key project of the first five-year plan.

"Martina of Rome, a patron saint of Rome, was martyred in 226, according to some authorities, more probably in 228, under the pontificate of Pope Urban I, according to others. Her feast day is January 30.

Biography
The daughter of an ex-consul and orphaned at an early age, she was described as a noble and beautiful virgin. She so openly testified to her Christian faith that she could not escape the persecutions under Severus Alexander. Arrested and commanded to return to idolatry, she refused, whereupon she was subjected to various tortures and was finally beheaded.

These tortures according to her vita include being scourged. She was condemned to be devoured by wild beasts in the amphitheater but was miraculously untouched by them. She was then thrown onto a burning pyre, from which she also escaped unhurt, and was finally beheaded. Her hagiography asserts that some of her executioners also converted to Christianity and were themselves beheaded.

Veneration
Ostia, at the mouth of the Tiber, was the scene of her martyrdom; but her body was transported to Rome, where a church near the Mamertine Prison, Santi Luca e Martina, was later dedicated in her honour.

On October 25, 1634, during restoration of the crypt, as was common at this time in Rome, buried remains were found by the painter Pietro da Cortona, president of the Accademia di San Luca, and were attributed to the martyred Saint Martina. No doubt it was hoped that this would precipitate an influx of funds to shelter the relics in a new church. Pope Urban VIII, who occupied the Holy See at that time, had the church repaired and, it would seem, composed the hymns which are sung at her office.

"Skyrack was a wapentake of the West Riding of Yorkshire, England. It was split into upper and lower divisions and centred in Headingley, Leeds.  The Lower Division included the parishes of Aberford,  Bardsey, Barwick-in-Elmet, Kippax, Thorner, Whitkirk and part of Harewood, while the Upper Division included the parishes of Adel, Bingley, Guiseley and parts of Harewood, Ilkley and Otley.

The Upper division of Skyrack was bounded to the north by the River Wharfe whilst the southern edge was bounded by the River Aire. Both divisions together contained 82 settlements.

The Skyrack wapentake derives its name from a large oak that grew for centuries in Headingley. It is believed that the word ""skyrack"" comes from the Old English phrase scir ac meaning ""Shire Oak"", under which meetings were held. The tree finally collapsed in 1941. There is a plaque to commemorate it on the outside of the garden wall of the Original Oak pub. It also gives its name to the Skyrack pub opposite the Original Oak. The pub, which is one of the stopping points on the Otley Run pub crawl, is a grade II listed building.

"Her Handwriting is the debut album by English indie pop band Trembling Blue Stars, released in May 1996 as the first album on Shinkansen Recordings.  The album is a intimate song cycle centred on the romantic break-up of frontman Bobby Wratten and Anne Mari Davies, his former bandmate in The Field Mice and Northern Picture Library.  After writing several songs about the break-up in early 1995 that Wratten believed to be messy, he discarded then, and engineer and musician Ian Catt persuaded him to record material based on the break-up in his own studios in Mitcham, South London, over the subsequent autumn and winter. Rachel's were an American chamber music group that formed in Louisville, Kentucky, in 1991.  Former Rodan guitarist Jason Noble played music individually and referred to himself as Rachel's but then began collaborating with core members violist Christian Frederickson and pianist Rachel Grimes.  The group's work was strongly influenced by classical music, particularly inspired by the minimalist music of the late 20th century, and its compositions reflect this.  While the trio formed the core part of the band, the group's recordings and performances featured a varying ensemble of musicians, who played a range of string instruments (including viola and cello) in combination with piano, guitars, electric bass guitar, and a drum set that included a large orchestral bass drum.  A key influence on the music of Rachel's was the music of the English composer Michael Nyman, whose music the group's work resembles in both instrumentation and compositional style. Handwriting is the debut LP of the instrumental group Rachel's.  It was released in May 1995 on Quarterstick Records.",Answer the following question based on the context: Handwriting is the debut of the a band from where?,

"Newspapers in Israel are mostly in Hebrew, but there are also newspapers catering to Arabic speakers, and newspapers catering to immigrants speaking a variety of languages, such as Russian, English and French. In 2022, a TGI survey indicated that Israel Hayom, distributed for free, is Israel's most read newspaper, with a 31% weekday readership exposure, followed by Yedioth Ahronoth, with 23.9%, Haaretz with 4.7%, and Maariv with 3.5%.

History
Ha-Levanon, the first Hebrew-language newspaper in pre-state Israel, was published on February 20, 1863. It was founded by Yoel Moshe Salomon (later a founder of Petah Tikva) and  (later a founder of Nahalat Shiv'a). About six months later, another Jerusalem weekly, HaHavatzelet, was founded by Israel Bak, who established the first Hebrew printing press in Jerusalem.

An analysis of the press of Palestine under the British Mandate in 1949 states: ""Palestine was a special case in journalism. No other area with a population of two million, of whom at least 30 percent are illiterate, could boast of 18 morning dailies, three evening papers, and a host of weeklies, bi-weeklies and monthlies."" 
 
In 2015, Reuters correspondent Tova Cohen described Israeli society in 2012 as ""news-obsessed."" Israel has a high newspaper readership rate, due to a combination of high literacy rate and a cultural interest in politics and current affairs. Average weekday readership of newspapers in Israel is around 21 papers per 100 people, although many Israelis end up reading more than one paper.

Controversy 
In March 2013, the editor-in-chief Damon Jaggars (Columbia University) and the complete editorial board resigned in protest of the limited authors' rights offered by the publisher under its copyright licensing terms. After negotiations by the editorial board with the publisher on behalf of authors committed to open access, the best offer made for publishing under a Creative Commons license was payment of nearly $3,000 by the author for each article, which was judged unacceptable by Jaggars and the board. Board member Chris Bourg wrote of a ""crisis of conscience about publishing in a journal that was not open access"" after the suicide of open access activist Aaron Swartz.

"The MV Hotspur IV is a historic passenger ferry, which previously operated on the Hythe Ferry service. This service connects the town of Hythe and the city of Southampton, across Southampton Water in England.

The Hotspur IV was built by Rowhedge Ironworks in 1946. She was the last, and slightly larger, of three half-sisters built for use on the Hythe Ferry, alongside the Hotspur II and Hotspur III. The use of the name Hotspur for several generations of Hythe ferries derives from the involvement, and later ownership, of the ferry service by the Percy family, whose member Hotspur was immortalised by William Shakespeare.

Hotspur II was sold in 1978 and continued in service on the Firth of Clyde under the name Kenilworth until 2007. The Hotspur III was broken up in 1981.

In 2012, the Hotspur IV received a new livery of green, following a re-branding of the Hythe Ferry.

In 2014 however, her life on the Hythe Ferry run came to an end, as the Hotspur IV  was forced out of service, after the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) ruled that it was unsafe for passenger use due to a corroding hull. Her future currently remains unclear.

"Crest Audio, Inc is an American company that produces professional sound equipment, including audio mixers, power amplifiers, and loudspeakers. Crest Audio was founded in the late 1970s by Jean-Pierre Prideaux in California. Dallas Music Industries (DMI) acquired Crest Audio in the 1980s and subsequently, Crest Audio was acquired by Peavey Electronics in 1999, and has since been based in Meridian, Mississippi. The company has an international network of distributors.

History
The company was founded in the late 1970s by Jean-Pierre (John) Prideaux to build power amplifiers for the tour sound industry. The first amplifier, the P3500, delivered 475 watts-per-channel in a chassis that occupied a two-rack space at a time when competitors were offering 400 watts in a four-rack space. In 1983, the 4001 amplifier was the first to provide two-ohms in a three-rack space chassis. Four years later the 8001 power amplifier became an industry standard concert sound amplifier. It was superseded by the 8002 model in 1998.

In 1989, Crest audio diversified into mixing consoles with its Gamble EX series. Two years later the company introduced NexSys, a computer-based network amplifier control system that became the basis of a range that addresses every aspect of installation configuration and control.

"Malva is a genus of about 25–30 species of herbaceous annual, biennial, and perennial plants in the family Malvaceae (of which it is the type genus), one of several closely related genera in the family to bear the common English name mallow.  The genus is widespread throughout the temperate, subtropical and tropical regions of Africa, Asia and Europe.  The word ""mallow"" is derived from Old English ""malwe"", which was imported from Latin ""malva"", cognate with Ancient Greek μαλάχη (malakhē) meaning ""mallow"", both perhaps reflecting a Mediterranean term.  A number of species, previously considered to belong to ""Lavatera"", have been moved to ""Malva"". Lavatera is a genus of about 25 species of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae, native to the Mediterranean region, central and eastern Asia, North America (California and Mexico) and Australia.  A number of species are naturalized in North America. Lagunaria is a monotypic genus in the family Malvaceae.  It is an Australian plant endemic to Lord Howe Island, Norfolk Island and parts of coastal Queensland.  It has been introduced to many parts of the world.  The genus was named for its resemblance to the earlier genus ""Laguna"" Cav., which was named in honour of Andrés Laguna, a Spanish botanist and a physician to Pope Julius III.","Answer the following question based on the context: Which genus has more species, Lagunaria or Lavatera?",

"Nanorana is a genus of dicroglossid frogs. They are found in Asia, from the Himalayan region of northern Pakistan and northern India, Nepal, and western China east to montane southern China and southeast to Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, and northern Vietnam. Common names of these frogs reflect the complex taxonomic history of the genus (see below) and include Yunnan slow frogs (or simply slow frogs) and High Himalaya frogs (for the now-synonymized genus Altirana).

Taxonomy
The taxonomy of true frogs and their allies has been subject to numerous changes during the last decade and is not yet fully settled. Nanorana in particular has seen big changes. As currently delineated, Nanorana is a quite large genus with 28 species, resulting from considering Chaparana, Paa, and Feirana as junior synonyms. Currently these taxa may be recognized as subgenera, but their delineation is not entirely settled and not all species have been assigned to subgenera. Note, however, that species at one point placed in these (sub)genera might currently be placed also in genera other than Nanorana (Quasipaa, Ombrana, and Allopaa).

Species
The following species are recognised in the genus Nanorana:

"A cystidium (: cystidia) is a relatively large cell found on the sporocarp of a basidiomycete (for example, on the surface of a mushroom gill), often between clusters of basidia. Since cystidia have highly varied and distinct shapes that are often unique to a particular species or genus, they are a useful micromorphological characteristic in the identification of basidiomycetes. In general, the adaptive significance of cystidia is not well understood.

Classification

By position
Cystidia may occur on the edge of a lamella (or analogous hymenophoral structure) (cheilocystidia), on the face of a lamella (pleurocystidia), on the surface of the cap (dermatocystidia or pileocystidia), on the margin of the cap (circumcystidia) or on the stipe (caulocystidia).  Especially the pleurocystidia and cheilocystidia are important for identification within many genera.  Sometimes the cheilocystidia give the gill edge a distinct colour which is visible to the naked eye or with a hand lens.

By morphology
Chrysocystidia are cystidia whose contents contain a distinct refractive yellow body, that becomes more deeply yellow when exposed to ammonia or other alkaline compounds. Chrysocystidia are characteristic of many (though not all) members of the agaric family Strophariaceae.

Gloeocystidia have an oily or granular appearance under the microscope.  Like gloeohyphae, they may be yellowish or clear (hyaline) and can sometimes selectively be coloured by sulphovanillin or other reagents. Metuloids are thick-walled cystidia with an apex having any of several distinct shapes.

"The Action of 18 June 1793 was the first decisive and one of the most celebrated encounters between British and French frigates during the French Revolutionary Wars.  The action occurred off Start Point in Devon, when the British frigate HMS ""Nymphe"" encountered and chased the French frigate ""Cléopâtre"".  During the previous month, ""Cléopâtre"" and another frigate, ""Sémillante"", had been successfully raiding British merchant shipping in the English Channel and Eastern Atlantic from their base at Cherbourg.  In response, the British frigates ""Nymphe"" and HMS ""Venus"" had been ordered to intercept and defeat the French frigates and on 27 May ""Venus"" and ""Sémillante"" fought an inconclusive engagement off Cape Finisterre. Merchant of Venus is a board game, published in 1988 by Avalon Hill, set in an unexplored part of the galaxy during a reawakening of galactic civilization.  Players move around the board as traders discovering long forgotten pockets of civilization and buying and selling goods.  The game can be played by one to six players.  In tournaments it is usually played by four players.  The solitaire version, which relies heavily on combat with a militaristic race, has different game mechanics. William Crabtree (1610–1644) was an astronomer, mathematician, and merchant from Broughton, then in the Hundred of Salford, Lancashire, England.

"Nannorrhops ritchiana, the Mazari palm, is the sole species in the genus Nannorrhops in the palm family Arecaceae.

Distribution
It is native to southwestern Asia, in the historical region of Balochistan, from the southeast of the Arabian Peninsula east through Iran and Afghanistan to Pakistan, growing at altitudes of up to 1,600 m.

Description
It is a shrub-like clumping palm, with several stems growing from a single base. The stems grow slowly and often tightly together, reaching  or more tall. It is a fan palm (Arecaceae tribe Corypheae), with the leaves with a long, smooth (unspined) petiole terminating in a rounded fan of 20–30 leaflets,  long, with a distinct glaucous blue-green to grey-green colour.

The flowers are borne in tall, open clusters up to  long at the top of the stems; it is usually dioecious with male and female flowers on separate plants. The fruit is a brown drupe. The individual stems are monocarpic, dying back to the ground after flowering, with the plant continuing growth from basal sprouts.

Cultivation 
It is one of the hardier palms, tolerating winter frosts down to about  (possibly even ), though it requires very hot summers for good growth. It can be grown in USDA zones 6-11. It is occasionally grown as an ornamental plant in southern Europe and southern North America, but is not widely cultivated.

"The Twelve Grapes (Sp. , ""the twelve grapes of luck"") is a Spanish tradition that consists of eating a grape with each of the twelve clock bell strikes at midnight of December 31 to welcome the New Year. Each grape and clock bell strike represents each of the coming twelve months.

This tradition dates back from at least 1895 but was consolidated among the population in 1909. In December of that year, some Alicantese vine growers spread this custom to better sell huge numbers of grapes from an excellent harvest. According to the tradition, eating the Twelve Grapes leads to a year of good luck and prosperity. In some areas, this practice was also believed to ward off witches and evil in general, although today it is mostly followed as a tradition to celebrate and welcome the New Year.

There are two types of places where people gather to eat the grapes: at home with family members after Nochevieja dinner, or in the main squares around the country, with the most famous being the Puerta del Sol in Madrid (and where this tradition started). The Twelve Grapes are closely related to the time ball and clock of the Royal House of the Post Office in Puerta del Sol, from where the change of year is broadcast on all major national television networks and radio stations, with television broadcasting beginning in 1962 on Televisión Española.

The Twelve Grapes have also been adopted in places with a broad cultural relation with Spain and Latin American countries, as well as Hispanic communities in countries such as the United States. This tradition is part of the Hispanic Christmas festivities.

"A student leader is any student who takes on the responsibility of spreading knowledge through inspiration, tutoring, campaigns etc.
A student leader strives to change the world by starting with their own community.

Position details
Student leadership positions are often made available through an application process. This process varies from school to school and position to position, some being highly selective, while others are relatively easy to fill. Some student leadership positions are unpaid, while others receive an hourly wage for their work. Many positions that have odd hours or unclear work times will receive a stipend rather than an hourly wage. This is often the case for resident assistants, members of student government, and student representatives on government boards or panels.

In a broader sense, a student leader can take up the responsibility of their community, their city, their country or the world and work towards it with or without the help of a mentor.

Although most student positions on government panels are advisory, the state boards of education of California and Massachusetts include student members with full voting authority.

Examples
A student leader could be any of the following roles.

Primary or secondary school 
 Member of student government, student council, or ASB.
 Teachers aide
 Peer mentor
 Member of any number of student clubs or organizations
 Peer-mediated instruction

"H6N2 is an avian influenza virus with two forms: one has a low and the other a high pathogenicity. It can cause a serious problem for poultry, and also infects ducks as well. H6N2 subtype is considered to be a non-pathogenic chicken virus, the host still unknown, but could strain from feral animals, and/or aquatic bird reservoirs. H6N2 along with H6N6 are viruses that are found to replicate in mice without preadaptation, and some have acquired the ability to bind to human-like receptors. Genetic markers for H6N2 include 22-amino acid stalk deletion in neuraminidase (NA) protein gene, increased N-glycosylation, and a D144 mutation of the Haemagglutinin (HA) protein gene. Transmission of avian influenza viruses from wild aquatic birds to domestic birds usually cause subclinical infections, and occasionally, respiratory disease and drops in egg production. Some histological features presented in chicken infected with H6N2 are fibrinous yolk peritonitis, salpingitis, oophoritis, nephritis, along with swollen kidneys as well.

"Heinrich Johann Nepomuk von Crantz (Roodt-sur-Eisch, Luxembourg, 25 November 1722 – 18 January 1799, Judenburg, Austria) was a botanist and a physician.

In 1750 he obtained his doctorate of medicine in Vienna, where he was a pupil of Gerard van Swieten (1700–1772). He studied obstetrics in Paris and London. In Paris he was influenced by André Levret (1703–1780) and Nicolas Puzos (1686–1753).

He was first married to Anna Susanne Petrasch and then to Magda Lena de Tremon. He had two sons and one daughter.

He became a lecturer in obstetrics at St. Mary's Hospital in Vienna in 1754. From 1756 to 1774, he taught physiology and materia medica at the university in that city.

He was the author of:
 Einleitung in eine wahre und gegründete Hebammenkunst (1756).
 Commentarius de rupto in partus doloribus a foetu utero (1756).
 Commentatio de instrumentorum in arte obstetricia historia utilitate et recta ac praepostera applicatione (1757).
 De systemate irritabilitatis (1761).
 Materia medica et chirurgica (three volumes, 1762) (Vol. 1 - 3 1765 Digital edition by the University and State Library Düsseldorf)
 De aquis medicatis principatus Transsylvaniae (1773).
 Die Gesundbrunnen der Österreichischen Monarchie (1777).

He recommended better methods of hygiene for midwives. In addition to his work in medicine, he studied  chemistry, botany, and the sources of mineral water.
The plant genus Crantzia (Gesneriaceae) was named for him by Thomas Nuttall.

"Verysdale is a part of medieval England which is mentioned in the early ballads of Robin Hood (especially the ballad A Gest of Robyn Hode, in which a friendly knight, Richard at the Lee, befriends the gallant outlaw and later is revealed as the lord or Earl of Verysdale). Verysdale may be entirely fictional, or it may be based upon a real county with some basis in geographical reality, or it may even have been a term used to refer to a real county. Scholars and historians are divided as to this, as well as the exact supposed location of Verysdale.

Some believe the location of Verysdale was somewhere in the Peak District (the ballad would seem to suggest so), although there are many suggestions and theories. Locations in West Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Lancashire, and Cumbria have all been suggested. One scholar equated Verysdale with Wensleydale whilst another equated it with Kirklees.

Also mentioned in the same ballad was ""Uterysdale"", which has been identified by some as relating to the village of Lee in the Wyre valley - Wyresdale (Lancashire) and references to Richard de Leghs [Leghe] in Lancashire to one in the village of Woodhouses (since 1974 in Greater Manchester) during the early 13th century. This bears a similarity to the title ""Richard at the Lee"" who is said to have been the lord of Verysdale.

"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey Through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the 10th Dimension (1994, ISBN  ) is a book by Michio Kaku, a theoretical physicist from the City College of New York.  It focuses on Kaku's studies of higher dimensions referred to as hyperspace.  The recurring theme of the book is that all four forces of the universe (the strong force, the weak force, electromagnetism and gravity) become more coherent and their description simpler in higher dimensions. Michio Kaku ( ; born on January 24, 1947 in San Jose, California) is a Japanese American theoretical physicist, futurist, and popularizer of science.  He is professor of theoretical physics at the City College of New York and CUNY Graduate Center.  Kaku has written several books about physics and related topics, has made frequent appearances on radio, television, and film, and writes online blogs and articles.  He has written three ""New York Times"" best sellers: ""Physics of the Impossible"" (2008), ""Physics of the Future"" (2011), and ""The Future of the Mind"" (2014).",Answer the following question based on the context: When was the writer of Hyperspace born?,
"Hostile-dependent relationships are characterized by either one sided, or a mutual atmosphere of hostility and aggression between the partners, which are endured due to the dependence of the partners involved (Aldrich, 1966).  Since the members of the relationship are dependent on one another, these characteristics can express themselves in complementary ways.  For example, between spouses where one is a sadist and the other a masochist, however many other forms are possible, for example, as abusive spousal relationships or in parental relationships with their dependent children (both young, teen and adult children) and in other circumstances of dependency.  Many members of hostile-dependent relationships remain together, despite the conflict between one another. Evolvulus is a genus of flowering plants in the Convolvulaceae, the morning glory family.  They are known generally as dwarf morning glories.  Most all are native to the Americas.  There are about 100 species. A flow tracer is any fluid property used to track flow.  The concentration of a chemical compound in the fluid can be used as a chemical tracer, and characteristics such as temperature are physical tracers.  Tracers may be artificially introduced, like dye tracers, or they may be naturally occurring; radioactive tracers may be either.  Conservative tracers remain constant following fluid parcels, whereas reactive tracers (such as compounds undergoing a mutual chemical reaction) grow or decay with time. Acalypha is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae.  It is the sole genus of the subtribe Acalyphinae.  It is one of the largest euphorb genera, with approximately 450 to 462 species.  The genus name ""Acalypha"" is from the Greek ακαλεφης, ""akalephes"" (""nettle""), and was inspired by the nettle-like leaves.  General common names include copperleaf.","Answer the following question based on the context: Evolvulus and Acalypha, have which mutual characteristics?",

"Bara Kaman is the unfinished mausoleum of Ali Adil Shah II in Bijapur, Karnataka in India.

Ali Adil Shah of the Adil Shahi dynasty wanted to build a mausoleum of unmatched architectural quality. It was planned that twelve arches would be placed vertically as well as horizontally surrounding the tomb of Ali Adil Shah. However, for unknown reasons the work on the structure was left incomplete: only two arches were raised vertically. Rumour has it that the construction of the mausoleum was stopped because once completed its shadow would touch the Gol Gombaz. Nowadays the remains of the twelve horizontally placed arches can still be seen.

The site is managed by the Archaeological Survey of India.

The Bara Kaman was built in 1672AD, by Ali Adil Shah II, and was supposed to be the burial mausoleum for the king and his wives. Bara Kaman has the tombs of Ali Adil Shah II, his wife Chand Bibi, his mistresses and his daughters.

The architect of Bara Kaman was Malik Sandal. The structure has raised walls in concentric arches. After the arches were erected, the inner arches were toppled, leaving only the outermost arch. No cement was used, instead iron rings were used to hold the stones together.

Born to a noble family of Venice, Justiniani entered the monastery of San Niccoló del Lido there in 1153.  When all other members of the Justiniani family died in the Aegean Sea, near Chios, during a Venetian military expedition in 1172, the government sent Baron Morosin and Toma Falier as delegates to Pope Alexander III, with the request to dispense Nicholas from his monastic vows.  This was granted, and Nicholas married Anna, the daughter of Doge Michieli.  Through this marriage, he founded five new lines of the Justiniani family. Shortly after 1179, he returned to the monastery.  His wife took the veil at a women's convent, which they had founded, on the Island of Aniano. Both Nicholas and Anna were venerated by the people after their deaths, although neither has ever been formally beatified.

"Epitadeus was an early 4th-century BC Spartan ephor, who strengthened conservative class distinctions by allowing gifts of land to independent citizens (Spartiates). This 4th century rhetra allowed the Spartiatai to dispose of their private land at will rather than by conventional hereditary descent.  This information is derived from a passage Plutarch's Life of Agis, who describes Epitadeus as headstrong and violent, and changing the rule as the result of a quarrel with his son.  Epitadeus is mentioned by no other ancient sources, and may well be a fictional character employed to explain the decline in the alleged equality of Sparta.

"Aspatria Island is an island in Australia.  It is located in the state of Queensland, in the eastern part of the country, 1600 km north of the capital, Canberra. Skiddaw is a mountain in the Lake District National Park in England.  Its 931 m summit is the sixth-highest in England.  It lies just north of the town of Keswick, Cumbria, and dominates the skyline in this part of the northern lakes.  It is the simplest of the Lake District mountains of this height to ascend (as there is a well-trodden tourist track from a car park to the north-east of Keswick, near the summit of Latrigg) and, as such, many walking guides recommend it to the occasional walker wishing to climb a mountain.  This is the first summit of the fell running challenge known as the Bob Graham Round when undertaken in a clockwise direction. Aspatria is a civil parish in the non-metropolitan district of Allerdale, and is currently embraced in the Parliamentary constituency of Workington.  Historically within Cumberland the town rests on the north side of the Ellen Valley, overlooking a panoramic view of the countryside, with Skiddaw to the South and the Solway Firth to the North.  Its developments are aligned approximately east-west along the A596 Carlisle to Workington road and these extend to approximately 2 miles (3 km) in length.  It lies about 8 miles (12 km) northeast of Maryport, a similar distance to the Southwest of Wigton, about 9 miles (14 km) north of Cockermouth and 5 miles (8 km) from the coast and Allonby.  It comprises the townships of Aspatria and Brayton, Hayton and Mealo, and Oughterside and Allerby, the united area being 8345 acres ; while the township takes up an area of 1600 acres .  In earlier days a Roman road leading from ""Old Carlisle"" to Ellenborough passed through the hamlet.",Answer the following question based on the context: Both Aspatria and Skiddaw are located in which country?,
"Umbra is a sans-serif display typeface designed in 1935 by R. Hunter Middleton for the Ludlow Typograph company.  It is an adaptation of the uppercase light weight of his earlier typeface Tempo. The name Umbra refers to its shadow effect, in which the actual letter shape consists of negative space and is defined solely by its black dimensional shadow. Several other typefaces were created in similar style around the same time, including shadowed weights of Gill Sans. Nebiolo's Ombra, part of their Semplicità family, is very similar.

Umbra has been digitised.

 an order in the Sympetalae.

 a subfamily in the family Compositae (as opposed to the subfamily Liguliflorae).

"Mid-Orange Correctional Facility was an all-male, medium security prison located in the town of Warwick, New York. It closed in 2011.

This facility was involved in a controversial case in which a correctional officer, Christopher Nuttall, started taking in cats left astray in the area. In collaboration with inmates, he cared for the cats and fed them. He was suspended and later fired on charges of ""contraband and collaboration with inmates"". Two months later, he was hired again, with the assistance of Council 82 (statewide correction officers union).

The prison was also the site of a strike by state prison employees in 1979. National Guardsmen were sent to the prison as strikebreakers, and were quartered in employee housing. This resulted in the only known caselaw for the Third Amendment, the US 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals case Engblom v. Carey.

The facility was targeted for closure in 2011 as part of Governor Andrew Cuomo's prison closing program. As of 2022, the area surrounding the prison has been converted to Wickham Woodlands, a town park, and is also being developed for corporate and light industrial use as the Warwick Valley Office & Technology Corporate Park.

"Arima Haruzumi (有馬 晴純, 1483 – March 19, 1566) was a Japanese feudal lord in the Sengoku period.

Biography 
Initially known as Arima Sadazumi, he held the title of Shuri-dayu and a position in the shobanshu, the private guard of the Shogun. His tenure as lord had the Arima at the height of their power, controlling trade in the strategically important Shimabara Peninsula, near modern-day Nagasaki. Ashikaga Yoshiharu, the 12th Ashikaga shōgun, recognizing his strategic importance and strength, allowed him to take a character from his name and call himself ""Haruzumi.""

In 1546 he attacked Ryuzoji Iekane's Mizu-ga-e Castle, and while he captured it, Iekane led a counterattack after a mere two months, recapturing it. After this, Haruzumi gave his second son in adoption to the Omura clan, and it was this son who would become Ōmura Sumitada. In the course of his tenure as lord, Haruzumi clashed with many local daimyōs such as the Goto, Hirai, Matsuura, Omura, Saigo, and Taku. He soon on expanded the Arima to control five districts of Hizen Province. As a result of his military conquests and political maneuvering, Haruzumi was able to control all of Hizen Province by way of political maneuvering.

In his later years, Portuguese vessels began to appear in the waters controlled by the Arima, and the family profited from foreign trade. While Christianity spread greatly, Haruzumi did not like the faith, and persecuted it.

His son Yoshisada succeeded him.

"The Allahverdi Khan Bridge (), popularly known as Si-o-se-pol (), is the largest of the eleven historical bridges on the Zayanderud, the largest river of the Iranian Plateau, in Isfahan, Iran.

The bridge was built in the early 17th century to serve as both a bridge and a dam. It is a popular recreational gathering place, and is one of the most famous examples of Iran's Safavid architecture.

History
Si-o-se-pol (meaning the bridge of 33 Persian) was built between 1599 and 1602, under the reign of Abbas I, the fifth Safavid king (shah) of Iran. It was constructed under the supervision of Allahverdi Khan Undiladze, the commander-in-chief of the armies, who was of Georgian origin, and was also named after him. The bridge served particularly as a connection between the mansions of the elite, as well as a link to the city's vital Armenian neighborhood of New Julfa.

In years of drought (2000–02 and 2013), the river was dammed upstream to provide water for Yazd province.

Structure
The bridge has a total length of  and a total width of . It is a vaulted arch bridge consisting of two superimposed rows of 33 arches, from whence its popular name of Si-o-se-pol comes, and is made of stone. The longest span is about . The interior of Si-o-se-pol was originally decorated with paintings, which were often described by travelers as erotic.

There is a larger base plank at the start of the bridge, under which the Zayanderud flows, supporting a tea house, which is nowadays abandoned.

"The Abencerrages or Abencerrajes (from the Arabic for ""Saddler's Son"") were a family or faction that is said to have held a prominent position in the Kingdom of Granada in the 15th century.

The name appears to have been derived from Yussuf ben-Serragh, the head of the tribe in the time of Muhammed VII, Sultan of Granada (1370–1408), who did that sovereign good service in his struggles to retain the crown of which he was three times deprived.

Little is known of the family with certainty. The Chambers Biographical Dictionary records that they arrived in Spain in the 8th century but the name is familiar from the romance by Ginés Pérez de Hita, Guerras civiles de Granada, which celebrates the feuds of the Abencerrages and the rival family of the Benedin (Arabic banu Edin), and the cruel treatment to which the former were subjected. J. P. de Florian's Gonsalve de Cordoue and Chateaubriand's Le dernier des Abencerrages are adaptations of Pérez de Hita's story.

The story is told that one of the Abencerrages, having fallen in love with a lady of the royal family, was caught in the act of climbing up to her window. The assassinations were ordered by Ibrahim Benedin, who had a feud with the family. He was enraged and shut up the whole family in one of the halls of the Alhambra, and gave orders to kill them all. The apartment where this is said to have taken place is one of the most beautiful courts of the Alhambra, and is still called the Hall of the Abencerrages.

Washington Irving in Tales of the Alhambra (1832) disagrees, saying the massacre was a fiction, but that a number of Abencerrages were killed in one of the battles at the time.  Nonetheless, many poems and plays, the novella The Abencerraje and two operas (Les Abencérages, by Luigi Cherubini, and L'esule di Granata, by Giacomo Meyerbeer) mention the legend.

The film was adapted from the eponymous pulp horror novel by John A. Russo, known also as the screenwriter for Night of the Living Dead.

Premise
In the Deep South, a diabolical, machete-wielding voodoo priest (Tony Todd) is busily turning Haitian migrant farm workers into flesh-eating, zombie slaves. However, his plans are disrupted by the arrival of two college students searching for a missing colleague who turns out to have been one of the priest's earlier zombie experiments.

 Raymond St. Jacques as Claude
 Theresa Merritt as Madame Daslay
 Gina Gershon as Tina

Production
Voodoo Dawn was shot in South Carolina.

Reception
Variety called it ""an atmospheric supernatural thriller for genre fans"".  Nigel Honeybone of HorrorNews.Net wrote that it should be watched by horror fans based on the novelty value of having been written by Russo. Peter Dendle wrote in The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia, ""Though acting and production value are solid, the script is outdated by about forty years and assumes we want to see more witch doctor than zombie.""

"The Sony Ericsson W950i is the third UIQ 3 smartphone based on Symbian OS v9.1. It was announced on February 13, 2006, a week after the announcement of the Sony Ericsson M600.

Background 
The W950 is Sony Ericsson's sixth 'Walkman'-series phone. One of its distinguishing features is the 4 GB internal flash memory, perfect for media storage. However, it does not support memory expansion with any type of memory card.

Hardware 
With many core similarities to the M600, the W950 also uses the UIQ 3 software platform, which is based upon Symbian OS 9.1. The touchscreen displays 262,144 colours (18-bit colour depth) with a resolution of 240x320 pixels at 2.6 inches long in diagonal. The W950 runs on the Nexperia PNX4008 ARM9 208 MHz processor from Philips and has 64MB RAM and 128MB Flash ROM. This processor also includes a PowerVR MBX GPU for hardware-accelerated 3D graphics.

Developing for the W950i 
Since the W950i is based upon the UIQ platform, it is easy to make third party applications that can be downloaded to the phone. Developers can choose their preferred programming language (Java, C++, etc.) and IDE (Visual Studio, CodeWarrior, Eclipse, Carbide, NetBeans).

"Kothammuriyattom is a village folk art form of northern Kerala, India. It is in fact Godavariyattom. Basically it is a theyyam (a popular ritual form of worship of North Malabar), with the image of a cow-face attached to mid part of the body. Usually a boy is selected to do this. Special hair work, face pack, and costumes accompany this. Paniyas also assist the main character. It is believed that, after this play, the country becomes prosperous with more yields and increased number of livestock. With drum patterns serving as the music, the speech is both socially conscious and humorous.

"Games played (GP) is a statistic used in team sports to indicate the total number of games in which a player has participated (in any capacity); the statistic is generally applied irrespective of whatever portion of the game is contested.

Baseball
In baseball, the statistic applies to players, who prior to a game, are included on a starting lineup card or are announced as an ex ante substitute, whether or not they play. For pitchers only, the statistic games pitched is used.

A notable example of the application of the above rule is pitcher Larry Yount, who suffered an injury while throwing warmup pitches after being summoned as a reliever in a Major League Baseball (MLB) game on September 15, 1971. He did not face a batter, but was credited with an appearance because he had been announced as a substitute. Yount never appeared in (or actually played in) any other MLB game.

Association football
In association football, a game played is counted if a player is in the starting 11, or if a reserve player enters the game before full-time.

Abdera was an ancient Carthaginian and Roman port on a hill above the modern Adra on the southeastern Mediterranean coast of Spain. It was located between Malaca (now Málaga) and Carthago Nova (now Cartagena) in the district inhabited by the Bastuli.

Name
Abdera shares its name with a city in Thrace and another in North Africa. Its coins bore the inscription  (). The first element in the name appears to be the Punic word for ""servant"" or ""slave""; the second element seems shared by the Phoenician names for Gadir (now Cadiz) and Cythera but of unclear meaning.

It appears in Greek sources as tà Ábdēra () and Aúdēra (), Ábdara (), and tò Ábdēron ().

History
Abdera was founded in the 8th century BCE as a Phoenician colony. It became a Carthaginian trading station and, after a period of decline, became one of the more important towns in the Roman province of Hispania Baetica. Tiberius seems to have made the place a Roman colony.

Coins
The most ancient coins bear its name with the head of Melqart and a tuna. Coins from the time of Tiberius show the town's main temple with two erect tunas as its columns. Early Roman coins were bilingual with Latin inscriptions on one side stating the name of the emperor and the town and with Punic text on the other side simply stating the name of the town.

"Howea is a genus of two palms, ""H. belmoreana"" and ""H. forsteriana"", both endemic to Lord Howe Island, Australia.  ""H. forsteriana"" in particular is commonly grown as an indoor plant in the Northern Hemisphere, and the two species form the mainstay of the island's palm seed industry and more importantly its trade in newly germinated seedlings.  The palms are also cultivated on Norfolk Island, where seeds are produced for export. Howea forsteriana (Kentia Palm or Thatch palm) is a species of flowering plant in the palm family Arecaeae, endemic to Lord Howe Island in Australia.  It is also widely grown on Norfolk Island.  It is a relatively slow-growing palm, eventually growing up to 10 m tall by 6 m wide.  Its fronds can reach 3 m long. Crinodendron is a botanic genus with 8 species of flowering plants belonging to the family Elaeocarpaceae.  They are evergreen shrubs or small trees native to the forests of Chile.  They have narrow, leathery evergreen leaves and pendent bell-shaped flowers in red, pink or white. Howea belmoreana, the curly palm, kentia palm, or Belmore sentry palm, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae, endemic to Lord Howe Island, Australia.  It and ""Howea forsteriana"" probably evolved from a common ancestor through sympatric speciation.  The canopy of a mature kentia palm tree spreads 5 - in diameter and contains roughly 36 leaves. Crinodendron hookerianum, known as the Chilean lantern tree, is an evergreen tree in the family Elaeocarpaceae.  It is endemic to Chile, where it occurs from Cautin to Palena (38 to 43°S).

An abstract of title lists all the owners of a piece of land, a house, or a building before it came into possession of the present owner. The abstract also records all deeds, wills, mortgages, and other documents that affect ownership of the property. An abstract describes a chain of transfers from owner to owner and any agreements by former owners that are binding on later owners.

Patent law
In the context of patent law and specifically in prior art searches, searching through abstracts is a common way to find relevant prior art document to question to novelty or inventive step (or non-obviousness in United States patent law) of an invention.

"Rebatching, or hand milling, is a soapmaking technique used by hobbyists and artisan soapmakers. The commercial equivalent is French milling.

In rebatching, commercially purchased or previously made soap (a soap base) is shredded or diced finely and mixed with a liquid, into which the soap shreds begin to dissolve. It is then heated at a fairly low temperature until the mass is more or less homogeneous. When it becomes translucent and reaches a thick, gel-like consistency, it is spooned or piped into molds and allowed to harden.

Soapmakers frequently use rebatching as a way of adding substances that could not withstand the high temperatures or caustic chemical environment of cold process or hot process soapmaking, such as certain essential oils (for example, those with a very low flash point). The choice of liquid affects the character of the finished soap; milk is frequently used to give the soap a smooth, creamy consistency. Rebatching can also be used as a way of salvaging soap that cracked, curdled or separated while being made.

As with the melt and pour process, rebatching does not necessarily involve saponification, and as such it is a misnomer to refer to it as soap-""making"".

"Abhorrers, the name given in 1679 to the persons who expressed their abhorrence at the action of those who had signed petitions urging King Charles II of England to assemble Parliament.

Feeling against Catholics, and especially against James, Duke of York, was running strongly; the Exclusion Bill had been passed by the House of Commons, and the popularity of James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth, was very great.

To prevent this bill from passing into law, Charles had dissolved the parliament in July 1679, and in the following October had prorogued its successor, which became known as the Exclusion Bill Parliament, without allowing it to meet.  He was then deluged with petitions urging him to call it together. This agitation was opposed by Sir George Jeffreys and Francis Wythens, who presented addresses expressing abhorrence of the Petitioners, and thus initiated the movement of the abhorrers, who supported the action of the king. ""The frolic went all over England,"" says Roger North; and the addresses of the Abhorrers which reached the king from all parts of the country formed a counterblast to those of the Petitioners. It is said that the terms Whig and Tory were first applied to English political parties as consequence of this dispute.

Formerly, it was placed in either the linden family (Tiliaceae) or the Sparrmanniaceae.  However, these were both not monophyletic with respect to other Malvales - as already indicated by the uncertainties surrounding placement of ""Grewia"" and similar genera - and have thus been merged into the Malvaceae.

"The Minidish is the tradename used for the small-sized satellite dish used by Freesat and Sky. The term has entered the vocabulary in the UK and Ireland as a generic term for a satellite dish, particularly small ones.

The Minidish is an oval, mesh satellite dish capable of reflecting signals broadcast in the upper X band and . Two sizes exist:
""Zone 1"" dishes are issued in southern and Northern  England and parts of Scotland and were 43 cm vertically prior to 2009; newer mark 4 dishes are approximately 50 cm
""Zone 2"" dishes are issued in elsewhere (Wales, Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland, Scotland and northern England), which are 57 cm vertically.

The Minidish uses a non-standard connector for the LNB, consisting of a peg about  in width and  in height prior to the mark 4 dishes introduced in 2009, as opposed to the 40 mm collar. This enforces the use of Sky-approved equipment, but also ensures that a suitable LNB is used. Due to the shape of the dish, an LNB with an oval feedhorn is required to get full signal.

"The politics of the Cayman Islands takes place within a framework of parliamentary democracy, within the confines of the Government of the Cayman Islands.

Constitutional Modernisation
Constitutional Modernisation has come to the forefront of politics recently with the collapse of the now defunct Euro Bank Corporation in 2003. The prosecution in the trial was forced to reveal that the British Government had planted moles (and used wire taps) throughout the banking industry using MI6, with the consent of the Governor. This caused the trial's collapse, and subsequent release of those charged with wrongdoing. Along with this, the only mole that was known at the time was allowed to leave the country, never to answer for what he (or the United Kingdom) was doing. This infuriated the elected members of the Legislative Assembly as they maintained that the Governor and the United Kingdom had put into question the Cayman Islands' reputation as a tightly regulated offshore jurisdiction. Some saw this as the United Kingdom meddling in the territory's affairs to benefit itself (and the EU), at the expense of the islands' economy. 

Constitutional talks however went on hold following Hurricane Ivan in 2004. Subsequently, in May 2005 the ruling UDP was ousted by the PPM, which restarted the process of constitutional modernisation. The new constitution took effect on 6 November 2009.

"Tamara Siler Jones is a writer of fantasy novels.

Her first novel, Ghosts in the Snow, won the Compton Crook Award in 2005. Her second, Threads of Malice, was nominated for the 2006 Gaylactic Spectrum Awards.

Her three books focus on a group of investigators in a society still recovering from a devastating ancient war, in the absence of many of the technologies it once enjoyed. The lead character, Dubric Byerly, is an aging noble, war veteran and widower who has responsibility for peace and security in Castle Faldorrah and its local villages. Along with his squire, Dien, and young assistant pages Lars and Otlee, Dubric solves crimes and enforces the law in Faldorrah.

What makes Dubric so good at his job, but so miserable in his own life, is his secret curse – since his wife's brutal death, he sees the ghosts of people murdered within the scope of his responsibility, and is haunted by these spectres until their killers are brought to justice.

The three books are a combination of fantasy and thriller, with the driving force in the plot being a particular mystery or crime. They contain consistently dark themes but are often balanced with a dry black humor.

Tamara Siler Jones now writes under a semi-pseudonym, Tambo Jones. She has produced additional works featuring Dubric Byerly, including but not limited to The Lord Apparent's Razor, Rabbits and Wasps, and Protection of the Holy Knights.

"Clinantheae is a tribe (in the family Amaryllidaceae, subfamily Amaryllidoideae), where it forms part of the Andean clade, one of two American clades.  The tribe was described in 2000 by Alan Meerow ""et al."" as a result of a molecular phylogenetic study of the American Amaryllidoideae.  This demonstrated that the Stenomesseae tribe, including the type genus ""Stenomesson"" was polyphyletic.  Part of the tribe segregated with the Eucharideae and were submerged into it, while the other part formed a unique subclade.  Since the type species of ""Stenomesson"" was not part of the second sublclade it was necessary to form a new name for the remaining species together with the other genera that remained.  This was ""Clinanthus"", the oldest name for these species, and consequently the tribe Clinantheae. Arctotis is a genus of annual and perennial plants in the family Asteraceae. Stenomesseae was a tribe (in the family Amaryllidaceae, subfamily Amaryllidoideae), where it forms part of the Andean clade, one of two American clades.  The tribe was originally described by Traub in his monograph on the Amaryllidaceae in 1963, as Stenomessae based on the type genus ""Stenomesson"".  In 1995 it was recognised that Eustephieae was a distinct group separate from the other Stenomesseae.  Subsequently, the Müller-Doblies' (1996) divided tribe Eustephieae into two subtribes, Stenomessinae and Eustephiinae. Stenomesson is a genus of bulbous plants in the family Amaryllidaceae.

"Indolamines are a family of neurotransmitters that share a common molecular structure (namely, indolamine). Indolamines are a classification of monoamine neurotransmitter, along with catecholamines and ethylamine derivatives. A common example of an indolamine is the tryptophan derivative serotonin, a neurotransmitter involved in mood and sleep. Another example of an indolamine is melatonin.

In biochemistry, indolamines are substituted indole compounds that contain an amino group.  Examples of indolamines include the lysergamides.

Synthesis 

 Indolamines are biologically synthesized from the essential amino acid tryptophan. Tryptophan is synthesized into serotonin through the addition of a hydroxyl group by the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase and the subsequent removal of the carboxyl group by the enzyme 5-HTP decarboxylase.

"August Wilhelm Ambros (17 November 181628 June 1876) was an Austrian composer and music historian of Czech descent.

Life 
He was born in Mýto, Rokycany District, Bohemia. His father was a cultured man, and his mother was the sister of Raphael Georg Kiesewetter (1773–1850), the musical archaeologist and collector. Ambros studied at the University of Prague and was well-educated in music and the arts, which were his abiding passion. He was, however, destined for the law and an official career in the Austrian civil service, and from 1839 he occupied various important posts under the ministry of justice, music being an avocation.

From 1850 onwards, he became well known as a critic and essay-writer, and in 1860 he began working on his magnum opus, his History of Music, which was published at intervals from 1862 in five volumes, the last two (1878, 1882) being edited and completed by Otto Kade and Wilhelm Langhans.

Ambros was a professor of the history of music at Prague from 1869 to 1871. Also in Prague, he sat on the board of governors in the Prague Royal Conservatory. By 1872, he was living in Vienna and was employed by the Department of Justice as an officer and by Prince Rudolf's family as his tutor. Through his work in Vienna, he was given a leave of absence for half the year in order to let him travel the world to collect musical information to include in his History of Music book. He was an excellent pianist, and the author of numerous compositions reminiscent of Felix Mendelssohn.

Ambros died at Vienna, Austria at the age of 59.

"Arecales is an order of flowering plants. The order has been widely recognised only for the past few decades; until then, the accepted name for the order including these plants was Principes.

Taxonomy
The APG IV system of 2016 places Dasypogonaceae in this order, after studies showing Dasypogonaceae as sister to Arecaceae. However, this decision has been called into question.

Historical taxonomical systems 
The Cronquist system of 1981 assigned the order to the subclass Arecidae in the class Liliopsida (= monocotyledons).

The Thorne system (1992) and the Dahlgren system assigned the order to the superorder Areciflorae, also called Arecanae in the subclass Liliidae (= monocotyledons), with the single family Arecaceae.

The APG II system of 2003 recognised the order and placed it in the clade commelinids in the monocots and uses this circumscription:

 order Arecales
 family Arecaceae, alternative name Palmae

This was unchanged from the APG system of 1998, although it used the spelling ""commelinoids"" instead of commelinids.

Principes 
In plant taxonomy, Principes is a botanical name, meaning ""the first"". It was used in the Engler system for an order in the Monocotyledones and later in the Kubitzki system. This order included one family only, the Palmae (alternate name Arecaceae). As the rules for botanical nomenclature provide for the use of such descriptive botanical names above the rank of family it is quite allowed to use this name even today, but in practice most systems prefer the name Arecales.

Following this, Principes became the name of the journal of the International Palm Society, becoming Palms in 1999.

The game remains under license to Hasbro by Rudell Design, LLC.  Upwords is similar to ""Scrabble"", or ""Words With Friends"", in that players build words using letter tiles on a gridded gameboard.  The point of difference is that in Upwords letters can be stacked on top of other letters already on the gameboard to create new words.  The higher the stack of letters, the more points are scored.  This typically makes words built in later turns of the game more valuable than earlier words, increasing play intensity and adding a level of strategy unique to Upwords.  The memorization of two-letter words is considered a useful skill in this game. Ghettopoly is a parody of ""Monopoly"" released in 2003.  Invented by David Chang, it uses ""Monopoly""-like mechanics in the atmosphere of a caricaturized United States ghetto.","Answer the following question based on the context: Upwords and Ghettopoly, are both forms of what?",

"Arthur Yoria is an American musician based in Houston, Texas, United States.

Born in Chicago on September 5, 1969, as Alvaro Arturo Guzman, Yoria started to play guitar very late while he was attending the University of Houston. After stints in the Houston-based bands, The Jeepneys and Lavendula, Arthur decided to set out on his own and released a 4-song, self-titled EP in 2001 followed by a 5-song EP, Can You Still Look Adorable in 2002. He has since released other EPs in both English and Spanish.

Yoria was nominated for several prizes in the Houston Press Music Awards. He founded 12 Records, Inc. together with his good friend and former Houston Rocket, Matt Maloney, and recorded I'll Be Here Awake which reached #8 on the specialty radio charts. One of Yoria's songs from that album, Here to Stay, was used in the Fox Television show The O.C. and in the final credits of the 2004 psychological thriller film Breaking Dawn. Yoria's work is featured on a regular basis in TV commercials for CheapBooks.com, since 2006.

Yoria has toured extensively in the U.S. as well as internationally, including Medellin Colombia at C.C. Monterrey in May 2011. Live he combines guitar and vocals with samples, loops, and digital effects. The tracks that are heard live are recorded immediately on stage and are then played under the current live track until that track too becomes a background layer.

"Scutellaria is a genus of flowering plants in the mint family, Lamiaceae.  They are known commonly as skullcaps.  The generic name is derived from the Latin ""scutella"", meaning ""a small dish, tray or platter"", or ""little dish"", referring to the shape of the calyx.  The common name alludes to the resemblance of the same structure to ""miniature medieval helmets"".  The genus has a subcosmopolitan distribution, with species occurring nearly worldwide, mainly in temperate regions. Anigozanthos is a small genus of Australian plants in the Bloodwort family Haemodoraceae.  The 11 species and several subspecies are commonly known as kangaroo paw and catspaw depending on the shape of their flowers.

"Binchō-tan (), also called white charcoal or binchō-zumi,  is a type of charcoal traditionally used in Japanese cooking. Its use dates to the Edo period, when, during the Genroku era, a craftsman named Bichū-ya Chōzaemon () began to produce it in Tanabe, Wakayama. The typical raw material used to make binchō-tan in Japan is oak, specifically , now the official tree of Wakayama Prefecture. Wakayama continues to be a major producer of high-quality charcoal, with the town of Minabe, Wakayama, producing more binchō-tan than any other town in Japan. Binchō-tan produced in Wakayama is referred to as Kishū binchō-tan (), Kishū being the old name of Wakayama.

White charcoal is made by pyrolysing wood in a kiln at approximately  for 120 hours, then raising the temperature to around . Once carbonised, the material is taken out and covered in a damp mixture of earth, sand and ash.

Binchō-tan is a type of hardwood charcoal which takes the natural shape of the wood that was used to make it. It is also harder than black charcoal, ringing with a metallic sound when struck. Due to its physical structure, binchō-tan takes on a whiter or even metallic appearance and, apart from being used for cooking, has other benefits such as absorption of odors.

In comparison, oga-tan is a type of biomass briquettes - a sawdust charcoal compressed into shapes with angular edges, often with a hole in the center. There exists a common misconception amongst restaurants and chefs that causes them to refer to oga-tan as binchō-tan.

Wind chimes and a musical instrument, the tankin (""charcoal-xylophone""), have been made from Binchō-tan.

The town's sister cities are Eaubonne, Cimișlia, and Sarandë.

History

The first recorded reference about the settlement dates back to 1431. In 1645 Vălenii de Munte (or Văleni for short) became the official residence of the then Săcueni County. Documents from 1832 note Valeni as having 518 households and 2,590 citizens. At the end of the 19th century, Vălenii de Munte was an urban commune, formed from the Văleni (Târgul-Văleni), Turburea, and Valea Gardului villages, having a total of 3,000 residents, who benefited from having a local hospital, pharmacy, post office, and telegraph station. In 1907 the historian Nicolae Iorga settled in Văleni, opening in January 1908 the People's Summer University. In 
1952 Vălenii de Munte became the residence of Teleajen Raion within the Poiești Region. The status was lost in the 1968 Administrative Reform, when Văleni became one of the towns of the newly established Prahova County.

"The Castle is a video game released by ASCII Corporation in 1986 for the FM-7 and X1 computers. It was later ported to the MSX and NEC branded personal computers, and got a single console port for the SG-1000. The game is set within a castle containing 100 rooms, most of which contain one or more puzzles.

It was followed by Castlequest (Castle Excellent in Japan). Both games are early examples of the Metroidvania genre.

Gameplay
The object of the game is to navigate through the Castle to rescue the Princess. The player can push certain objects throughout the game to accomplish progress. In some rooms, the prince can only advance to the next room by aligning cement blocks, Honey Jars, Candle Cakes, and Elevator Controlling Block. Additionally, the player's progress is blocked by many doors requiring a key of the same color to unlock, and a key is removed from the player's inventory upon use. The prince must be standing on a platform next to the door to be able to unlock it, and cannot simply jump or fall and press against the door. The player can navigate the castle with the help of a map that can be obtained early in the game. The map will provide the player with a matrix of 10x10 rooms and will highlight the room in which the princess is located and the rooms that he had visited. The player must also avoid touching enemies like Knights, Bishops, Wizards, Fire Spirits, Attack Cats and Phantom Flowers.

"The tro Khmer () is a traditional bowed string instrument from Cambodia.  Its body is made from a special type of coconut covered on one end with snake skin, and it has three strings. Instruments are not standardized, and coconuts vary in size; however the instrument's sound bowl may have dimensions 16.5 cm by 14 cm. In the past the strings were made of silk. By the 1960s, metal strings were in use, and the sound of the instrument changed, becoming sharper.

The tro Khmer is closely related to a Thai instrument called saw sam sai.

The instrument may be related to the similarly shaped Indonesian version of the rebab, arriving there from Muslim culture, c. 15th century a.d. A difference between the two is the number of stings; where the Indonesian rebab has two strings, the tro Khmer has three.

"Shanqella (Amharic: ሻንቅላ šanqəlla sometimes spelled Shankella, Shangella, Shánkala, Shankalla or Shangalla) is an exonym for a number of ethnic groups that today reside primarily in the westernmost part of Ethiopia near South Sudan (especially the Benishangul-Gumuz Region), but are known to have also inhabited more northerly areas until the late nineteenth century. A pejorative, the term was traditionally used by the local Afro-Asiatic-speaking populations to refer in general terms to darker-skinned ethnic groups, particularly to those from communities speaking Nilo-Saharan languages of Western Ethiopia. These were regarded as slave reserves by the highlanders. The etymology of Shanqella is uncertain. It has been suggested that the appellation may stem from an Amharic epithet meaning ""black"" (or dark-skinned). However, it is likely that the term is instead of more ancient, Agaw derivation given the Agaw substratum in the Amharic language. The 1935 League of Nations report detailed the dehumanization of Shanqella under the Ethiopian Empire.

"A light-addressable potentiometric sensor (LAPS) is a sensor that uses light (e.g. LEDs) to select what will be measured. Light can activate carriers in semiconductors.

History 

An example is the pH-sensitive LAPS (range pH4 to pH10) that uses LEDs in combination with (semi-conducting) silicon and pH-sensitive Ta2O5 (SiO2; Si3N4) insulator. The LAPS has several advantages over other types of chemical sensors. The sensor surface is completely flat, no structures, wiring or passivation are required. At the same time, the ""light-addressability"" of the LAPS makes it possible to obtain a spatially resolved map of the distribution of the ion concentration in the specimen. The spatial resolution of the LAPS is an important factor and is determined by the beam size and the lateral diffusion of photocarries in the semiconductor substrate. By illuminating parts of the semiconductor surface, electron-hole pairs are generated and a photocurrent flows. The LAPS is a semiconductor based chemical sensor with an electrolyte-insulator-semiconductor (EIS) structure. Under a fixed bias voltage, the AC (kHz range) photocurrent signal varies depending on the solution.  A two-dimensional mapping of the surface from the LAPS is possible by using a scanning laser beam.

"The Pomme de Terre River (pronounced pohm de TEHR) is a  tributary of the Osage River in southwestern Missouri in the United States.  Via the Osage and Missouri rivers, it is part of the watershed of the Mississippi River.

Pomme de terre is French for potato, a food Indians harvested in the area.  Before the French explorers, the Osage people, who were historically indigenous to the region, had called it a name meaning Big Bone River, referring to the fossils of mastodons and other ancient creatures which they found along its eroding banks.

Course
The Pomme de Terre River is formed in Greene County in the Ozarks by the confluence of its short north and south forks, which rise in Webster and Greene counties, respectively.  The river flows generally northward through Dallas, Polk, Hickory and Benton counties, past the town of Hermitage.  In Polk County it collects the short Little Pomme de Terre River, which rises in Greene County and flows generally northwestwardly.  In Hickory County a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dam causes the river to form Pomme de Terre Lake.  It enters the Osage River as an arm of Truman Lake, which is formed by a dam on the Osage.

History
The valley of the Kelkit has been a passage to the Black Sea coast for thousands of years, was once part of the Roman Empire and from 381 the succeeding Byzantine Empire. Arab invaders occupied the valley in 778 followed by early settlements of the Oghuz Turks. Fighting between Turks and Byzantines continued in this corner of Anatolia for centuries, beyond the arrival of the Seljuk Turkish armies of Toğrül Bey in 1058, and the foundation of the Empire of Trebizond of which Çamoluk was part. The castle was built by the Trapezuntines in 1204 to defend the valley from further waves of Seljuk invaders.

"Toxicodendron rydbergii, the western poison ivy or northern poison oak, is a species of Toxicodendron in the cashew family native to North America.

Description 
Unlike Toxicodendron radicans (eastern poison ivy), which often appears as a trailing or climbing vine, Toxicodendron rydbergii is a shrub that can grow to 1 m (3 ft) tall, rarely up to 3 m (10 ft). The leaves are trifoliate and alternate.  The leaflets are variable in size and shape, and are usually 15 cm (6 in) long, turning yellow or orange in autumn. On the compound trifoliate leaves, the two leaflets opposite each other are typically asymmetrical, in contrast to the terminal leaflet which always shows bilateral symmetry.  The fruits are small, round, and yellowish. Like other members of its genus, all parts of this plant contain urushiol, which can cause severe contact dermatitis in most individuals.

Distribution and habitat 
It is native to most of Canada from the Maritimes to British Columbia, and most of the contiguous United States except the Southeast, Nevada, Oregon and California. It is apparently extirpated from West Virginia. It can be found growing in forests, and other wooded areas, usually near streams and rivers.

"Henry Purcell ( or ; c. 10 September 1659 – 21 November 1695) was an English composer.  Although incorporating Italian and French stylistic elements into his compositions, Purcell's legacy was a uniquely English form of Baroque music.  He is generally considered to be one of the greatest English composers; no other native-born English composer approached his fame until Edward Elgar, Ralph Vaughan Williams, William Walton and Benjamin Britten in the 20th century. Armonico Consort is a British company founded in 2001 by conductor (music) and organist Christopher Monks, which specialises in producing performances of Renaissance music and Baroque music.

Armonico Consort is known for its innovative productions, most notably its 2005 production of Henry Purcell’s The Fairy-Queen and its performances of Mozart’s Magic Flute at the Barbican Centre in London in 2007.  In 2012 Armonico Consort’s opera, Too Hot To Handel, featuring the music of Baroque composer George Frideric Handel, attracted highly positive reviews from critics.

There are also two minor islands, Formica and Maraone, lying between Levanzo and Sicily. For administrative purposes the archipelago constitutes the comune of Favignana in the Province of Trapani.

The overall population in 2017 was 4,292. Winter frost is unknown and rainfall is low. The main occupation of the islanders is fishing, and the largest tuna fishery in Sicily is there.

History

There is evidence of Neolithic and even Paleolithic paintings in caves on Levanzo, and to a lesser extent on Favignana.

The islands were the scene of the battle of the Aegates of 241 BC, in which the Carthaginian fleet was defeated by the Roman fleet led by Lutatius Catulus; the engagement ended the First Punic War. After the end of Western Roman power in the first millennium AD, the islands, to the extent that they were governed at all, were part of territories of Goths, Vandals, Saracens, before the Normans fortified Favignana in 1081.

The islands belonged to the Pallavicini-Rusconi family of Genoa until 1874, when the Florio family of Palermo bought them.

"Glashaus is a German band consisting of lead singer Cassandra Steen, songwriter and rapper Moses Pelham, and producer Martin Haas. The trio is best known for their mixture of R&B, soul and pop music with lyrics in German language.

History 
In 2000, while searching for new talented singers, producers and label partners Moses Pelham and Martin Haas were introduced to vocalist Cassandra Steen (by then principally known for her appearances on the latest album by Freundeskreis). Although they soon started working on what was to be Steen's solo album, the project moved into a collaborative endeavor and as a result the trio decided to form a band – later named Glashaus.

After months of recording Glashaus finally released their debut single ""Wenn das Liebe ist"" in 2001. The song became the band's biggest hit to date when it debuted at No. 21 on the German singles charts, reaching its peak position of No. 5 in its third week. While the following singles, ""Was immer es ist"", Rio Reiser cover ""Ohne dich"", and ""Trost (es tut weh)"", failed to chart or sell notably, they helped keeping the band's self-titled debut album in the German media charts for over 30 weeks and got the band nominated for three ECHO Award.

"The Muras are an indigenous people who live in the central and eastern parts of Amazonas, Brazil, along the Amazon river from the Madeira to the Purus. They played an important part in Brazilian history during colonial times and were known for their quiet determination and subsequent resistance to the encroaching Portuguese culture.  Formerly a powerful people, they were defeated by their neighbors, the Munduruku, in 1788.

Of the original diversity of Muran languages, only Pirahã survives today.

Historical encounter with the Portuguese
According to Adélia Engrácia de Oliveira in Autos da devassa contra os índios Mura do Rio Madeira e nações do Rio Tocantins (1738–1739) (CEDEAM, 1986:1): ""It is known that they, who used their canoes as homes, nomadic indians (""Índios de Corso""), controlled a wide area of land from the border of Peru to River Trombetas, that they stood out for their great effort to repel the encroaching of the Portuguese, that they were valiant and fearless warriors, using special attack tactics, and that their incursions and raids frightened 18th century Amazonas.""

Territory

There are about 15,713 Mura people in Brazil.
About 587 of them occupy the Cunhã-Sapucaia Indigenous Territory along the Igapó-Açu River, which runs through the territory from west to east.
The lower part of the Matupiri River enters the territory, where it flows into the Igapó-Açu River.
The Matupi provides the main way to access the Matupiri State Park.
In an unusual arrangement, the Mura people have an ""indigenous special use zone"" in the state park that allows them to continue to fish and extract forest products, as they have for many generations.

"Kristine L. Holzer (born March 21, 1974) is an American Olympic speed skater.

Diagnosed with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) when she was 13 years old, Holzer originally took up rowing at Gonzaga University because the sport was low-impact.  Despite her difficult past, Holzer excelled at rowing and upon graduation moved to Augusta, Georgia to train with the United States Sculling squad under the watchful eye of Coach Igor Grinko.  Holzer remained in Augusta for two summers, where due to the combination of her small stature, almost frightening work ethic, and surprising speed on the water, she earned the nickname ""Pocket Rocket.""  Kristine's rowing career peaked at the 1998 United States Senior National Team Trials, where she finished second in the women's double sculls.  After being snubbed for a spot as a spare in the 1998 World Rowing Championships, Kristine decided to take up speedskating at the age of 24 (despite having only skated once in her life).

After narrowly missing a spot on the 2002 Winter Olympic squad, Holzer skated at the 2006 Winter Olympics and finished in 27th place in the 3000 meters.

"Nuttallanthus is a genus of four species of herbaceous annuals and perennials that was traditionally placed in the foxglove family Scrophulariaceae.  Due to new genetic research, it has now been placed in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae.  Three species of ""Nuttallanthus"" are native to North America and one to South America.  ""Nuttallanthus"" was until the 1980s included in a wider circumscription of the genus ""Linaria"", a genus now considered restricted to the Old World. Stangeriaceae is the smallest family of cycads, both in number of living and fossil species.  The family contains only two living genera, ""Stangeria"" and ""Bowenia"", though the latter genus has been recommended for placement in a separate family by itself. Stangeria eriopus is a cycad endemic to southern Africa It is the sole species in the genus Stangeria, most closely related to the Australian genus ""Bowenia"", with which it forms the family Stangeriaceae.  IUCN Red List Category & Criteria: Vulnerable, mainly due to habitat loss and over-exploiting for traditional medicine.  It is listed under CITES Appendix I / EU Annex A, and CITES prohibits international trade in specimens of this species except when the purpose of the import is not commercial, for instance for scientific research. The Antirrhineae are one of the 12 tribes of the Plantaginaceae family.  It contains the toadflax relatives, such as snapdragons.  They are probably most closely related to the turtlehead tribe (Cheloneae) and/or a large and badly resolved core group of their family including plants as diverse as water-starworts (""Callitriche""), foxgloves (""Digitalis""), and speedwell (""Veronica"").

"Operation Bruilof () was a planned military operation in 1978 by the South African Defence Force during the South African Border War and Angolan Civil War.

Background 
The operation was planned for May 1978, to be conducted by 61 Mechanised Infantry Battalion Group and paratroops.  This was to be the first mechanised force to be deployed by the South African forces during the war and consisted of the then new Ratel Infantry Fighting Vehicles as well as Eland Armoured Cars.

The plan called for the SADF to cross the South-West Africa–Angola border, with the battle group attacking and destroying six South-West Africa People's Organisation bases around Chetequera before withdrawing.

The plan was eventually abandoned and merged into what became Operation Reindeer planned for the 4 May.

"Garff () is one of the six sheadings of the Isle of Man.

It is located on the east of the island (part of the traditional South Side division) and consists of the two historic parishes of Lonan and Maughold. Before 1796 it also included the parish of Onchan.

Administratively, since May 2016 the sheading of Garff has been covered by a single Garff local authority, a parish district, formed by merging the former village district of Laxey with the parish districts of Lonan and Maughold.

The town of Ramsey, which is administered separately, covers areas of two historic parishes (Maughold, and Lezayre in the sheading of Ayre). It is treated as part of Garff for some purposes, e.g. the coroner.

Other settlements in the sheading include Baldrine and Ballabeg (both in the parish of Lonan), and Ballure in the parish of Maughold.

Etymology

The origin of the name is uncertain. Kneen (1925) suggests that it derives from the Norse gröf (N.B. not grðf, which is a typo there), meaning a pit or ravine (cognate with ""grave"").

MHKs and elections
Garff is also a House of Keys constituency (excluding (most of) Onchan). It was originally a three-seat constituency, but this was reduced to two seats in 1893 and one seat in 1986. Until 2016 it was heavily under-represented by having only a single MHK. However in the 2016 general election it elected 2 MHKs (the new constituency also includes the (sparsely populated) parish of Onchan, i.e. excluding the village of Onchan).

"The Volunteer Defence Corps (VDC) was an Australian part-time volunteer military force of World War II modelled on the British Home Guard. The VDC was established in July 1940 by the Returned and Services League of Australia (RSL) and was initially composed of ex-servicemen who had served in World War I. The government took over control of the VDC in May 1941, and gave the organisation the role of training for guerrilla warfare, collecting local intelligence and providing static defence of each unit's home area. General Harry Chauvel, who had retired in 1930, was recalled to duty in 1940 and appointed Inspector-General of the VDC. Chauvel held this position until his death in March 1945.

Following the outbreak of the Pacific War, the Government expanded the VDC in February 1942. Membership was open to men aged between 18 and 60, including those working in reserved occupations. As a result, there were, by 1944, nearly 100,000 men in the VDC, organized into 111 battalions consisting of about 1,500 full-time personnel, over 30,000 part-time active members and over 43,000 part-time reserve members of the Volunteer Defence Corps.

As the perceived threat to Australia declined the VDC's role changed from static defence to operating anti-aircraft artillery, coastal artillery and searchlights. Members of inland VDC units were freed from having to attend regular training in May 1944 and the VDC was officially disbanded on 24 August 1945.

"Brunnera is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae.  They are rhizomatous perennials, native to the woodlands of Eastern Europe and North West Asia.  They have hairy leaves and sprays of blue flowers in spring.  Numerous cultivars are available, which are valued as groundcover in dappled shade.  Some possess variegated foliage.  The best known species is ""Brunnera macrophylla"", known as Siberian bugloss. Codonanthe is a New World genus, consists of a dozen or more species of evergreen epiphytic compact creeping vines with rooting along their stems, and scandent herbs or subshrubs with woody, upright stems from Brazil, Guiana, Central America and West Indies.  In its own habitat, the plant usually grows in association with tree ant nests.  The botanical name comes from the ""Greek"" for bellflower.  Small red stems held flat or hanging, about 30cm long, with pairs of relatively succulent, hard-surfaced and small round dark foliage.  Delicate, pale-pink to white, bell-shaped flowers grow from the leaf axil, either single or in group and always produce in a large number.  Flower tube has 2 lips, each with 2 and 3 lobes; which may be white, pink, lilac to deep purple with yellow throat.  These delightful waxy flowers are strongly scented.  Colorful berry-like fruits appear after flowering.  Seeds look like ant eggs or larvae, which are carried to the nest by ants and inserted into the fertile nest wall where they germinate.  Seeds that germinate outside a nest tend to grow more slowly.",Answer the following question based on the context: Are Brunnera and Codonanthe from the same locations?,

"A smart host or smarthost is an email server via which third parties can send emails and have them forwarded on to the email recipients' email servers.

Smarthosts were originally open mail relays, but most providers now require authentication from the sender, to verify that the sender is authorised – for example, an ISP might run a smarthost for their paying customers only.

Use in spam control efforts
In an effort to reduce email spam originating from their customer's IP addresses, some internet service providers (ISPs), will not allow their customers to communicate directly with recipient mailservers via the default SMTP port number 25. Instead, often they will set up a smarthost to which their customers can direct all their outward mail – or customers could alternatively use one of the commercial smarthost services.

Sometimes, even if an outward port 25 is not blocked, an individual or organisation's normal external IP address has a difficulty in getting SMTP mail accepted. This could be because that IP was assigned in the past to someone who sent spam from it, or appears to be a dynamic address such as typically used for home connection. Whatever the reason for the ""poor reputation"" or ""blacklisting"", they can choose to redirect all their email out to an external smarthost for delivery.

Reducing complexity
When a host runs its own local mail server, a smart host is often used to transmit all mail to other systems through a central mail server. This is used to ease the management of a single mail server with aliases, security, and Internet access rather than maintaining numerous local mail servers.

Playing career
Typically playing as a left winger, Ryznar was selected by the New Jersey Devils as the 64th choice (third round) of the 2002 NHL Entry Draft.

Rynzar played for the United States Junior National Team in 2000 and 2001 before heading to the University of Michigan where he would play for four seasons, growing in stature as a checking line player.

In 2005–06, Ryznar played with the Albany River Rats of the American Hockey League, the Devils minor-league affiliate.

In January 2005, he was called up by the Devils - due to injuries and suspensions - and played sparingly as a fourth-liner. His call-up as a first-year pro was a rarity for the normally deep and methodical New Jersey Devils.

After the 2007–08 season, Ryznar wasn't offered a contract by the Devils and was invited to the Minnesota Wild training camp on September 18, 2008. Ryznar was then sent on a try-out to affiliate,  Houston Aeros, on September 28, 2008. Ryznar made the Aeros opening night roster for the 2008–09 season.

Etymology
The first element of the name is probably the extinct Cumbric cair 'fortification', though Gaelic cathair has been suggested. The second element is generally taken as Cumbric lanerx, meaning 'clearing' (cf. Welsh llanerch). Another suggestion is that the name is Cumbric cair + Old English lang 'long' and hrycg 'ridge'.

"The Tata Theatre is a 1010-seat premier staging facility for music, dance and drama at The National Centre for the Performing Arts complex in the city of Mumbai, India. It is India’s first theatre designed and built keeping in mind the unique acoustic and visual requirements for the staging of Indian music, dance and related art forms, and was constructed by Larsen & Toubro Limited. The theatre was inaugurated by the then Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi on the 11 of October 1980.

Keeping in mind the traditional seating requirements at Indian classical musical concerts and performances, the Tata Theatre stage is built in the almost semi-circular thrust shape. The alternate concave and convex triangular forms on the overhead and the wall panelings ensure even distribution of acoustics over the entire auditorium. The acoustic forms of high-density compressed plaster were handmade and lifted manually up into their positions. The architects  ensured that every musical instrument played in the orchestra could individually be heard and appreciated in every corner of the auditorium.

The external structure of the Tata Theatre complex has been acoustically insulated from outside interference such as road traffic and sounds from construction and maintenance activities by separate pile foundations down to the rock base.

Famous artistes who have performed at the Tata Theatre over the years include Yehudi Menuhin, Ustad Vilayat Khan and M S Subbalaxmi. The Tata Theatre has also been utilized for special cultural programmes for India’s state guests and visiting dignitaries. Its spacious foyers are also used for special exhibitions.

"Spam mass is defined as ""the measure of the impact of link spamming on a page's ranking.""  The concept was developed by Zoltán Gyöngyi and Hector Garcia-Molina of Stanford University in association with Pavel Berkhin and Jan Pedersen of Yahoo!.  This paper expands upon their proposed TrustRank methodology.

The researchers developed a good core and a bad core of selected Web documents, from which they measured spam mass across a collection of documents.  Two types of measurements, absolute mass and relative mass, are used to compare groups of documents.  The higher the mass measurements, the more likely the documents are to be equivalent to spam.

Thresholds 
A threshold value is used to identify groups of documents as spam.  If their relative mass value exceeds the threshold, the documents are considered to be spam.  A second threshold for the PageRank values of the selected documents is applied.  Only high PageRank documents are labelled as spam.

The purpose of the methodology is to identify spam documents with artificially inflated PageRank values.

"Aegospotami (, Aigos Potamoi) or Aegospotamos (i.e. Goat Streams) is the ancient Greek name for a small river issuing into the Hellespont (Modern Turkish Çanakkale Boğazı), northeast of Sestos.

At its mouth was the scene of the decisive battle in 405 BC in which Lysander destroyed the Athenian fleet, ending the Peloponnesian War. The ancient Greek township of the same name, whose existence is attested by coins of the 5th and 4th centuries, and the river itself were located in ancient Thrace in the Chersonese.

According to ancient sources including Pliny the Elder and Aristotle, in 467 BC a large meteorite landed near Aegospotami. It was described as brown in colour and the size of a wagon load. A comet, tentatively identified as Halley's Comet, was reported at the time the meteorite landed. This is possibly the first European record of Halley's comet.

Aegospotami is located on the Dardanelles, northeast of the modern Turkish town of Sütlüce, Gelibolu.

"""Pies Descalzos, Sueños Blancos"" (English: Bare Feet, White Dreams) is the third single from Shakira's third studio album Pies Descalzos (1996). Written and composed by her, ""Pies Descalzos, Sueños Blancos"" talks about all the rules that the human race has invented since Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit.  It is a social satire in both the lyrics and the music video. The song was performed in the latter half of Shakira's Oral Fixation Tour, and there is a Portuguese version called ""Pés Descalços"".

Background and composition
In 1990, a thirteen-year-old Shakira signed a recording contract with Sony Music and released her debut studio album Magia in 1991, which largely consisted of tracks she had written since she was eight years old. Commercially, the project struggled, selling an underwhelming 1,200 copies in her native Colombia. Her follow-up record Peligro was released in 1993, and suffered a similar failure. Consequently, Shakira took a two-year hiatus, allowing her to complete her high school education.

Looking to revive her struggling career, Shakira released her first major-label studio album Pies Descalzos in 1996 by Sony Music and Columbia Records.  Assuming a prominent position in its production, she co-wrote and co-produced each of the eleven tracks included on the record.

Music video
The music video was directed by Gustavo Garzón. The video shows an upper class masquerade ball, an image often used to represent the personas people wear in society.  A door opens that shows Shakira singing and also shows images of all the rules that society has created from the past to now.

It was nominated for Video of the Year at the 9th Lo Nuestro Awards. There is also a Portuguese version of this song, called ""Pés Descalços"".

"Andreas Aagesen (5 August 1826 – 26 October 1879) was a Danish jurist.

Biography
Aagesen was educated for the law at Christianshavn and Copenhagen, and interrupted his studies in 1848 to take part in the First Schleswig War, in which he served as the leader of a reserve battalion.

In 1855 Aagesen became a professor of jurisprudence at the University of Copenhagen. In 1870 he was appointed a member of the commission  for drawing up a maritime and commercial code, and the navigation  law of 1882 is mainly his work. In 1879 he was elected a member of the Landsting (one of two chambers of the Danish Parliament, the Rigsdagen); but it is as a teacher at the university that he won his reputation. Aagesen was Carl Christian Hall's successor as lecturer on Roman law at the university, and in this department his research was epoch-making.

Bibliography
Among his numerous juridical works may be mentioned:
Bidrag til Læren om Overdragelse af Ejendomsret, Bemærkinger om Rettigheder over Ting (Copenhagen, 1866, 1871–1872);
Fortegnelse over Retssamlinger, Retslitteratur i Danmark, Norge, Sverige (Copenhagen, 1876).

"The Claudine series consists of four early novels by French authors Colette and Henry Gauthier-Villars, published 1900–1904. Written in diary form, they describe the growth to maturity of a young girl, Claudine. Aged fifteen at the beginning of the first book, Claudine at School, the series describes her education and experiences as she grows up. All the books are written in first-person with the first three having Claudine herself as the narrator.  The last in the series, Claudine s'en va, introduces a new narrator, Annie.

The novels were written in the late 19th century in collaboration with Colette's first husband, the writer Henry Gauthier-Villars, better known by his pen name ""Willy"". There has been much speculation over the degree of involvement of both Colette and Willy in the writing of the Claudine novels, particularly as Willy was known for often using ghostwriters. Consequently, although the novels were originally attributed to Willy only and published under his name alone, they were later published under both names. After the death of Willy, Colette went to court to challenge her former husband's involvement in any of the writing, and subsequently had his name removed from the books. This decision however was overturned after her death, as Willy's son from a prior relationship, Jacques Gauthier-Villars, successfully sued to have his father's name restored.

The Claudine novels are thought to be roughly autobiographical.

 Claudine à l'école (1900) – Claudine at School
 Claudine à Paris (1901) – Claudine in Paris
 Claudine en ménage (1902) – Claudine Married
 Claudine s'en va (1903) – Claudine and Annie

"Shopping channels (also known in British English as teleshopping) are a type of television program or specialty channel devoted to home shopping. Their formats typically feature live presentations and demonstrations of products, hosted by on-air presenters and other spokespeople who provide a sales pitch for the product. Viewers are also instructed on how they can order the product. Shopping channels may focus primarily on mainstream merchandise, or more specialized categories such as high-end fashion and jewelry. The term can also apply to channels whose programming consists exclusively of direct-response advertising and infomercials.

The concept was first popularized in the United States in the 1980s, when Lowell ""Bud"" Paxson and Roy Speer launched a local cable channel known as the Home Shopping Club—which later launched nationally as the Home Shopping Network (HSN). It later gained competition from QVC, who would eventually acquire HSN in 2017. Home shopping channels originally relied on telephone ordering, but have since been required to emphasize online shopping as part of their business models in order to compete with online-only competitors (while distinguishing themselves with their use of on-air pitches and offers to entice potential customers). In 2015, QVC acquired the retailer Zulily in an effort to expand its presence in online retail. ShopHQ is another US-based shopping channel.

Outside of the US, few of the notable shopping channels are TV Shop, QVC UK in Europe, The Shopping Channel in New Zealand, Shop TV in Philippines and TSC in Canada.

"In human anatomy, the facial skeleton of the skull the external surface of the mandible is marked in the median line by a faint ridge, indicating the mandibular symphysis (Latin: symphysis menti) or line of junction where the two lateral halves of the mandible typically fuse at an early period of life (1-2 years). It is not a true symphysis as there is no cartilage between the two sides of the mandible.

This ridge divides below and encloses a triangular eminence, the mental protuberance, the base of which is depressed in the center but raised on either side to form the mental tubercle. The lowest (most inferior) end of the mandibular symphysis — the point of the chin — is called the ""menton"".

It serves as the origin for the geniohyoid and the genioglossus muscles.

Other animals

Solitary mammalian carnivores that rely on a powerful canine bite to subdue their prey have a strong mandibular symphysis, while pack hunters delivering shallow bites have a weaker one. When filter feeding, the baleen whales, of the suborder Mysticeti, can dynamically expand their oral cavity in order to accommodate enormous volumes of sea water.  This is made possible thanks to its mandibular skull joints, especially the elastic mandibular symphysis which permits both dentaries to be rotated independently in two planes. This flexible jaw, which made the titanic body sizes of baleen whales possible, is not present in early whales and most likely evolved within Mysticeti.

"Dave Tatsuno (born Masaharu Tatsuno August 18, 1913 – January 26, 2006, in California) was a Japanese American businessman who documented life in his family's internment camp during World War II. His footage was later compiled into the film Topaz (named for the Topaz War Relocation Center where he was confined). The film was placed in the National Film Registry, part of the Library of Congress, in 1997.

Tatsuno was a 1936 graduate of the University of California, Berkeley. After graduation, he went to work at Nichi Bei Bussan, a San Francisco department store his father established in 1902. At Topaz, Tatsuno was put in charge of the camp's co-operative store. Upon Tatsuno's release from Topaz in 1945, he reopened his store but moved his family to San Jose in 1948 after his 7-year-old son died during a routine tonsillectomy. Besides being a prominent civic leader, he spent most of his post-war years running Nichi Bei Bussan and had opened a second one in San Jose after relocating his family there. The San Jose store is run by one of his daughters while San Francisco store closed in 1997 after the death of his brother Masateru ""Tut"".

Tatsuno was predeceased by his wife Alice (died in 2005; née Okada), whom he married in 1938, and a son. He was survived by their five other children, four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

"The Markusbierg tunnels are a pair of parallel tunnels, which form the most easterly section of the A13 motorway through Luxembourg, near the town of Schengen.  The tunnels are 1575 metres in length, and descend easterly, towards the German border at a 5% gradient.  The eastern end of the tunnel runs directly to a viaduct crossing the river Moselle, which forms the border with Germany.

Construction work was initiated on 15 September 1997 and the tunnels opened to public traffic on 24 July 2003, along with the rest of the A13 motorway. Total construction costs were €65m, including €15m for the installation of added security systems.

Each tunnel has regular emergency crossing points into the other, to allow escape in case of emergency.  In addition to the normal lighting of the tunnels, and because of their gradient and curve, the road edges (including the kerb) are also fully illuminated, which helps to indicate the tight radius. Support staff are located near the German border.

"BadTrans is a malicious Microsoft Windows computer worm distributed by e-mail. Because of a known vulnerability in older versions of Internet Explorer, some email programs, such as Microsoft's Outlook Express and Microsoft Outlook programs, may install and execute the worm as soon as the e-mail message is viewed.

Once executed, the worm replicates by sending copies of itself to other e-mail addresses found on the host's machine, and installs a keystroke logger, which then captures everything typed on the affected computer.  Badtrans then transmits the data to one of several e-mail addresses. 

Among the e-mail addresses that received the keyloggers were free addresses at Excite, Yahoo, and IJustGotFired.com.

The target address at IJustGotFired began receiving emails at 3:23pm on November 24, 2001.  Once the account exceeded its quotas, it was automatically disabled, but the messages were still saved as they arrived.  The address received over 100,000 keylogs in the first day alone.

In mid-December, the FBI contacted Rudy Rucker, Jr., owner of MonkeyBrains, and requested a copy of the keylogged data. All of that data was stolen from the victims of the worm; it includes no information about the creator of Badtrans.
Instead of complying with the FBI request, MonkeyBrains published a database website, https://web.archive.org/web/20070621140432/https://badtrans.monkeybrains.net/ for the public to determine if a given address has been compromised.

"Christian Gauss (1878 – 1951) was a literary critic and professor of literature.

Biography
Gauss was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan. His father had fled Württemberg when Prussia began to dominate it in the 1860s. The son graduated from the University of Michigan at 20, worked as a newspaper correspondent in Paris, covering the Dreyfus case during which time he met Oscar Wilde who dedicated one of his poems to Gauss.

Later Gauss taught at Michigan and Lehigh University in the United States, and in 1905 became a first preceptor at Princeton University, where he remained until his retirement in 1946.

At Princeton, Gauss became a full professor of French Literature two years after his arrival; he was chairman of the department of modern languages; and he served as dean. After retiring from Princeton, he was president of Phi Beta Kappa. The academic society awards a Christian Gauss Award.

Though he was not a prolific author or a public figure, Gauss left a mark on literary scholarship: Princeton University's semiannual series of Christian Gauss Seminars in Criticism (founded in 1949 by R.P. Blackmur), and Phi Beta Kappa's annual Christian Gauss Award (est. 1950) for a book of literary criticism are named in his honor. Gauss influenced and corresponded frequently with F. Scott Fitzgerald and Edmund Wilson.

Composition
The band composed original music for the film, by adding electronic music to hand drums, woodwinds and strings. Elements of music in India and the Middle East and jazz were also incorporated into the score.

While the score has some Middle Ages influence, this is not found in the scenes where Duncan is assassinated and Macbeth is killed. Polanski and the band used aleatoric music for these scenes, to communicate chaos.

"In population genetics, a selection coefficient, usually denoted by the letter s, is a measure of differences in relative fitness. Selection coefficients are central to the quantitative description of evolution, since fitness differences determine the change in genotype frequencies attributable to selection.

The following definition of s is commonly used. Suppose that there are two genotypes A and B in a population with relative fitnesses  and  respectively. Then, choosing genotype A as our point of reference, we have , and , where s measures the fitness advantage (s>0) or disadvantage (s<0) of B.

For example, the lactose-tolerant allele spread from very low frequencies to high frequencies in less than 9000 years since farming with an estimated selection coefficient of 0.09-0.19 for a Scandinavian population. Though this selection coefficient might seem like a very small number, over evolutionary time, the favored alleles accumulate in the population and become more and more common, potentially reaching fixation.

These conditions are (see also proof below) that (1) the number of terms in the sum is large and (2) the terms themselves scale exponentially with this number. A typical application is the calculation of a thermodynamic potential from a partition function. These functions often contain terms with factorials  which scale as  (Stirling's approximation).

"Brunfelsia plowmaniana is a species of flowering plant of the nightshade family that is native to the cloud forests of the Bolivian and Argentinian Andes.  It was first described in 2012 on the basis of systematic DNA barcoding of specimens from the genus ""Brunfelsia"".  Specimens belonging to the new species had previously been placed in the polymorphic species ""B. uniflora"", which a molecular phylogeny revealed as polyphyletic. Alocasia is a genus of broad-leaved rhizomatous or tuberous perennials from the family Araceae.  There are 79 species native to tropical and subtropical Asia to Eastern Australia, and widely cultivated elsewhere. Brunfelsia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Solanaceae, the nightshades.  There are about 50 species described.  Linnaeus named the genus for the early German herbalist Otto Brunfels (1488–1534).  Common names for the genus include raintree. Xanthosoma is a genus of flowering plants in the arum family, Araceae.  The genus is native to tropical America but widely cultivated and naturalized in other tropical regions.

It is named for three members of the Trammell family: (1) U.S. Senator from Florida and former governor Park M. Trammell, who died in office in 1936; (2) his brother, John D. Trammell, member of the Florida legislature representing Calhoun County (Blountstown) who introduced the bill to construct the original bridge; and (3) Robert D. Trammell, John Trammell's grandson who represented the area in the Florida legislature and secured funding for the new bridge.

The westbound and eastbound lanes of SR 20 are on separate spans. The westbound span is the original, older bridge (opened in 1938) and the eastbound span is a modern, concrete high-rise bridge (opened in 1998).

The original bridge (westbound) was built of steel and concrete piers by the Wisconsin Iron and Bridge Company. In 1989, the original span was listed in A Guide to Florida's Historic Architecture, published by the University of Florida Press.

The Eastern end of the bridge is in the Eastern Time zone, while the Western end is in the Central Time zone.

The Commissioner of Social Security frequently speaks to NOSSCR meetings, providing updates on the federal programs.

NOSSCR recognizes persons who have provided special service to the disabled through the Eileen Sweeney Distinguished Service Award, given to ""individuals whose outstanding service has resulted in a significant improvement in the quality of advocacy for Social Security claimants, a significant increase in the availability of advocacy for Social Security claimants, or a significant improvement in the Social Security adjudicatory process.""

The organization states that its members are committed to providing high quality representation for claimants, to maintaining a system of full and fair adjudication for every claimant, and to advocating for beneficial change in the disability determination and adjudication process.

"Proprietary hardware is computer hardware whose interface is controlled by the proprietor, often under patent or trade-secret protection.

Historically, most early computer hardware was designed as proprietary until the 1980s, when IBM PC changed this paradigm. Earlier, in the 1970s, many vendors tried to challenge IBM's monopoly in the mainframe computer market by reverse engineering and producing hardware components electrically compatible with expensive equipment and (usually) able to run the same software. Those vendors were nicknamed plug compatible manufacturers (PCMs).

"In law, an answer was originally a solemn assertion in opposition to someone or something, and thus generally any counter-statement or defense, a reply to a question or response, or objection, or a correct solution of a problem.

In the common law, an answer is the first pleading by a defendant, usually filed and served upon the plaintiff within a certain strict time limit after a civil complaint or criminal information or indictment has been served upon the defendant.  It may have been preceded by an optional ""pre-answer"" motion to dismiss or demurrer; if such a motion is unsuccessful, the defendant must file an answer to the complaint or risk an adverse default judgment.

In a criminal case, there is usually an arraignment or some other kind of appearance before the defendant comes to court.  The pleading in the criminal case, which is entered on the record in open court, is usually either guilty or not guilty. Generally speaking in private, civil cases there is no plea entered of guilt or innocence. There is only a judgment that grants money damages or some other kind of equitable remedy such as restitution or a permanent injunction. Criminal cases may lead to fines or other punishment, such as imprisonment.

The famous Latin Responsa Prudentium (""answers of the learned ones"") were the accumulated views of many successive generations of Roman lawyers, a body of legal opinion which gradually became authoritative.

During debates of a contentious nature, deflection, colloquially known as 'changing the topic', has been widely observed, and is often seen as a failure to answer a question.

"The Cholones are a tribe of South American Indians in Peru, living on the left bank of the Huallaga River in the Amazon valley. The name
is that given them by the Spanish. They were first met by the Franciscans, who established mission villages among them in 1676.

Life
Cholones were living in the district of Tingo Maria, having their own language, Tinganeses, Seeptsa, which was formerly spoken in the valley of Huallaga River from Tingo Maria to Valle. In 1985 there were only one or two speakers of Tinganeses, Seeptsa. Father Francisco Gutierrez of Franciscans composed a work on their language. Cholones believe that carrying the poisonous tooth of a serpent is a protection against the bite of a serpent.

Economy and trade
The common economic pursuits of Cholones include agriculture, hunting, and fishing. Women were engaged in cultivating cotton and weaving.  For centuries, the lowland Cholones had trade relations with the highland Hibitos across the bank of the Huallaga river.  Some of the important products, which were generally traded, include feather, wax, honey, stone and metal axes, coca, cotton, hardwoods and medicinal herbs.

"Hershey's Kisses is a brand of chocolate manufactured by The Hershey Company.  The bite-sized pieces of chocolate have a distinctive shape, commonly described as flat-bottomed teardrops.  Hershey's Kisses chocolates are wrapped in squares of lightweight aluminum foil with a narrow strip of paper protruding from the top. Reese's Pieces are a peanut butter candy manufactured by The Hershey Company solely for the North American market; they are oblate spheroid in shape and covered in candy shells that are colored yellow, orange, or brown.  They can be purchased in plastic packets, cardboard boxes, or cup-shaped travel containers.  The candy was introduced in 1977, and introduced to Canada in 1980.  The then relatively new product became very popular with the 1982 release of ""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial"", in which the candy is featured. Hershey Kissables were a chocolate candy sold by The Hershey Company from late 2005 to 2009.  Comparable to M&M's, Hershey Kissables were shaped like miniature Hershey's Kisses and were coated in a thick sugar shell. Kisses is a term used in Britain and North America to describe various items of small sugar confectionery, defined by their shape rather than a similar recipe.  The most famous brand using this name is Hershey's Kisses.  It is sometimes applied to confections with a hard exterior and a soft filling, such as chocolate-dipped marshmallows, or two small biscuits or cookies sandwiched together with a soft icing.  There are corresponding terms in other countries, such as the Italian ""bocconetti di mandorla"" (almond kisses) and the Indian cool kiss. Good & Fruity is a multicolored, multiflavor candy with a similar shape to Good & Plenty.  Unlike Good & Plenty, Good & Fruity contained red licorice.

"The Café Wars took place during the Algerian War, as a part of the internal fighting in France between two rival Algerian nationalist movements, the Mouvement National Algérien and the Front de Libération National (which later became the ruling political party in independent Algeria).

The Café Wars are so called because part of the fighting took the form of bomb attacks and assassinations in cafés, directed at supporters of the other party, as they struggled for control and influence over the large Algerian expatriate community and its organizations. Since both organizations operated underground, and were wanted by the French government, the line between a military and a civilian target was hard to draw, and often wilfully disregarded by the combatants. Groups from both the MNA and the FLN resorted to gangland-style killings, intimidation and the murder of civilians to pursue their political goals and secure finances and influence. This led to the Café Wars being portrayed in France as acts of random terrorism, and conflated with attacks on French settlers in Algeria.

According to some estimates the Café Wars cost an estimated 5,000 lives. The official French figures are 3,975 dead and a total of 10,223 victims (dead or wounded).

The Café Wars did not end before Algeria was granted independence in 1962, by the government of Charles de Gaulle. The FLN had by then routed the MNA's guerrilla units in Algeria, and for all practical purposes destroyed its organization in France.

"Kogarah is an electoral district of the Legislative Assembly in the Australian state of New South Wales. The electorate is located in St George. It is represented by Chris Minns of the Australian Labor Party.

Kogarah includes the Sydney suburbs of Allawah, Beverly Hills, Carlton, Carss Park, Kogarah and parts of Bexley, Bexley North, Blakehurst, Hurstville, Kingsgrove, Penshurst and South Hurstville.

History
Kogarah was created for the 1930 election, partly replacing the abolished districts of Oatley and St George. It was a marginal seat in the 1930s and 1940s but, since 1953, it became increasingly safe for Labor.

The seat was first won by former state MP for St George and Oatley, Mark Gosling of the Labor Party. However, following factionalism, splits and sectarianism within the state and federal Labor parties, the United Australia Party, later the Liberal Party, won the seat at the 1932 election. Winning back the seat in 1941, the Labor Party have since held the seat for seventy-eight of the seats ninety-three years of its existence.

"Strange Cargo 2 is the third album by electronic instrumentalist William Orbit. It was released in 1990. The album is the second in a series of similarly titled albums: Strange Cargo, Strange Cargo III, and Strange Cargo Hinterland.

Critical reception

The Chicago Tribune called the album ""a mix of light jazz, funk and a smattering of world music to make it all seem somehow exotic.""

AllMusic wrote that ""though there's a bit more electronics on this record, [Orbit] still seems uncommonly fixated with textural touches like Spanish guitar, and the effect is much more Windham Hill than Warp.""

(Conductive plate surface resistivity can be controlled between 103 ≈105; anti-static sheet surface resistivity can be controlled between 106 ≈1011.)

As with all corrugated plastic, it is widely used for signage, plastic containers, and reusable packaging. It is also used by hobbyists in do it yourself projects such as constructing cages for small animals or model aircraft.

Modifying Coroplast sheets
All Coroplast twin-wall profile sheets can be modified with additives, which are melt-blended into the sheet to meet the specific needs of the customer. Special products that require additives include: UV protection, anti-static, flame retardant, and custom colors.

The water contains trace amounts of radium, and the water temperature is 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius) year-round.

Prior to the discovery of radium in the water in 1925, the site was known as ""Blue Springs"".

A casino was built overlooking the springs in the 1920s, and Radium Springs was a popular spa and resort. Northerners traveling by train to spend winter in Florida often stopped to swim in the springs, which were thought at the time to be healthful because of the radium content. 
The casino was severely damaged when the river flooded in 1999 and again in 1998,and was demolished in 2003.

"John Hardy Robson (15 April 1899 – 1995) was a Scottish footballer, who played as a goalkeeper.

Born in Innerleithen, Tweeddale, Robson played as a goalkeeper despite only standing at 5'8"". Robson had served in the First World War with the Seaforth Highlanders; after returning home he played for local side Vale of Leithen. In November 1921, Robson was signed by Arsenal for £5, and initially was the club's third-choice goalkeeper behind Ernest Williamson and Stephen Dunn. With little experience and his lack of height, he was never expected to be thrust into the first team, but after first Williamson and then Dunn suffered poor form, Robson made his debut for Arsenal against Bolton Wanderers on 26 December 1922. Arsenal won 5-0 and Robson kept his place.

Robson played for the rest of the 1922–23 season, keeping twelve clean sheets in twenty matches, and he became an ever-present in the Arsenal side for the next season and a half; Arsenal were by no means a top side at this time, flirting dangerously with relegation in 1924 and 1925, but Robson's athletic keeping helped keep them up. However, after Welsh international Dan Lewis joined Arsenal in late 1924, Robson had to share goalkeeping duties with him.

Robson started the 1925–26 season as first-choice but after new Arsenal manager Herbert Chapman signed Bill Harper in November 1925, Robson's days at Arsenal were numbered. He made his last first-team appearance in a 5–2 win against Manchester City on 7 November 1925. After spending the rest of the season in the reserves, Robson left Arsenal in August 1926 for Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic. In all, he played 101 matches for Arsenal.

"Cistus salviifolius, common names sage-leaved rock-rose, salvia cistus or Gallipoli rose, is a perennial ligneous plant of the family Cistaceae. Kohleria is a New World genus of the flowering plant family Gesneriaceae.  The plants are generally tropical herbs or subshrubs with velvety stems and foliage and brightly colored flowers with spots or markings in contrasting colors.  They are rhizomatous and commonly include a period of dormancy in their growth cycle.  The genus was recently revised by Kvist & Skog (1992) and was recognized as having 19 species distributed in Central America and South America.  Recent phylogenetic work by Roalson et al. (2005) indicated that the epiphytic genus ""Capanea"" is derived from within Kohleria, and the two species of ""Capanea"" were subsequently transferred to ""Kohleria"".  The genus ""Pearcea"" is closely related. Cistus (from the Greek ""kistos"") is a genus of flowering plants in the rockrose family Cistaceae, containing about 20 species (Ellul ""et al."" 2002).  They are perennial shrubs found on dry or rocky soils throughout the Mediterranean region, from Morocco and Portugal through to the Middle East, and also on the Canary Islands. Cistus monspeliensis is a species of rockrose known by the common name Montpellier cistus.  It is native to southern Europe and northern Africa, in the Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub ecosystems of matorral—maquis shrublands.

In the agony of the Umayyad dynasty in the Al-Andalus (Moorish Iberia), two princes of the house were proclaimed Caliph of Córdoba for a very short time, Abd-ar-Rahman IV Mortada (1017), and Abd-ar-Rahman V Mostadir (1023–1024). Both were the mere puppets of factions, who deserted them at once. Abd-ar-Rahman IV was murdered the same year he was proclaimed at Cadiz, in flight from a battle in which he had been deserted by his supporters.

"In group theory, Higman's embedding theorem states that every finitely generated recursively presented group R   can be embedded as a subgroup of some finitely presented group G. This is a result of Graham Higman from the 1960s.

On the other hand, it is an easy theorem that every finitely generated subgroup of a finitely presented group is recursively presented, so the recursively presented finitely generated groups are (up to isomorphism) exactly the finitely generated subgroups of finitely presented groups.

Since every countable group is a subgroup of a finitely generated group, the theorem can be restated for those groups.

As a corollary, there is a universal finitely presented group that contains all finitely presented groups as subgroups (up to isomorphism);  in fact, its finitely generated subgroups are exactly the finitely generated recursively presented groups (again, up to isomorphism).

Higman's embedding theorem also implies the Novikov-Boone theorem (originally proved in the 1950s by other methods) about the existence of a finitely presented group with algorithmically undecidable word problem. Indeed, it is fairly easy to construct a finitely generated recursively presented group with undecidable word problem. Then any finitely presented group that contains this group as a subgroup will have undecidable word problem as well.

The usual proof of the theorem uses a sequence of HNN extensions starting with R and ending with a group G which can be shown to have a finite presentation.

"Murrumbidgee is a former electoral district of the Legislative Assembly in the Australian state of New South Wales, named after the Murrumbidgee River.

History

Until its abolition, Murrumbidgee and Parramatta were the only electorates to have existed continuously since the first Legislative Assembly election in 1856, although before 1913 it was called The Murrumbidgee. It elected two members between 1856 and 1859, one member between 1859 and 1880, two members between 1880 and 1885, three members between 1885 and 1894 and one member between 1894 and 1920. Voters cast a vote for each vacancy. Between 1920 and 1927, it absorbed parts of Lachlan and Ashburnham and elected three members under proportional representation. From 1927 until its abolition at the 2015 election, it elected one member.

At the 2007 election it included most of Junee Shire (including Junee, Wantabadgery, Harefield, Old Junee and Junee Reefs) Temora Shire, Coolamon Shire, Bland Shire, part of Lachlan Shire (including Condobolin, Lake Cargelligo and Burcher), Narrandera Shire, Leeton Shire, the City of Griffith, Murrumbidgee Shire and part of Carrathool Shire (including Rankins Springs and Carrathool).

Murrumbidgee was abolished at the 2015 election with the recreated electoral district of Cootamundra absorbing Junee Shire, Temora Shire, Coolamon Shire, Bland Shire and Narrandera Shire, the recreated electoral district of Murray absorbing Leeton Shire, the City of Griffith, Murrumbidgee Shire and Carrathool and the Electoral district of Barwon absorbing Lachlan Shire.

"Andronicus of Cyrrhus or Andronicus Cyrrhestes (Latin; , Andrónikos Kyrrhēstēs; ) was a Hellenized Macedonian astronomer best known for designing the Tower of the Winds in Roman Athens.

Life
Little is known about the life of Andronicus, although his father is recorded as Hermias. It is usually assumed that he came from the Cyrrhus in Macedonia rather than the one in Syria.

Work
Andronicus is usually credited with the construction of the Tower of the Winds in the Roman forum at Athens around  a considerable portion of which still exists. It is octagonal, with figures of the eight principal winds (Anemoi) carved on the appropriate side. Originally, a bronze figure of Triton was placed on the summit that was turned round by the wind so that the rod in his hand pointed to the correct wind direction, an idea replicated with subsequent wind vanes. The interior housed a large clepsydra and the exterior housed multiple sundials so that it functioned as a kind of early clocktower.

He also built a multifaced sundial for the Temple of Poseidon on the island of Tinos.

"The Water Leaper, also known as Llamhigyn Y Dwr, is an evil creature from Welsh folklore that lived in swamps and ponds.

It is described as a giant frog with a bat's wings instead of forelegs, no hind legs, and a long, lizard-like tail with a stinger at the end. It jumps across the water using its wings, hence its name.

It was blamed for problems ranging from snapping fishing lines to eating livestock or even fishermen.

"Wat Florida Dhammaram () is a Buddhist monastery in Kissimmee, Florida, established by Lung-po Chaokhun Phra Tepvaraporn (Im Arindhamo) in the mid-1990s.

History
Lung-po visited lay-devotees in Florida and perceived the lack of a Buddhist monastery in the Central Florida area. After gaining approval from the late abbot of Wat Sommanat Vihara, Chaokhun Somdej Phra Wannarat Chop Thitadhammamahathera, he began fund raising in Thailand. In 1993, three monks were sent with Prakrupalad Sunnan (now Chaokhun Phra Vijitrdhammapani, the present abbot) to establish and further the development of Wat Florida Dhammaram.

"Amaryllis ( ) is the only genus in the subtribe Amaryllidinae (tribe Amaryllideae).  It is a small genus of flowering bulbs, with two species.  The better known of the two, ""Amaryllis belladonna"", is a native of the Western Cape region of South Africa, particularly the rocky southwest area between the Olifants River Valley to Knysna.  For many years there was confusion among botanists over the generic names ""Amaryllis"" and ""Hippeastrum"", one result of which is that the common name ""amaryllis"" is mainly used for cultivars of the genus ""Hippeastrum"", widely sold in the winter months for their ability to bloom indoors.  Plants of the genus ""Amaryllis"" are known as belladonna lily, Jersey lily, naked lady, amarillo, Easter lily in Southern Australia or, in South Africa, March lily due to its propensity to flower around March.  This is one of numerous genera with the common name ""lily"" due to their flower shape and growth habit.  However, they are only distantly related to the true lily, ""Lilium"". Hippeastrum is a genus of about 90 species and over 600 hybrids and cultivars of perennial herbaceous bulbous plants.  They generally have large fleshy bulbs and tall broad leaves, generally evergreen, and large red or purple flowers. Codariocalyx is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae.  It belongs to the subfamily Faboideae.  This genus has been largely debated with the genus ""Desmodium"" on whether they are separate or the same genus. Desmodium is a genus in the flowering plant family Fabaceae, sometimes called tick-trefoil, tick clover, hitch hikers or beggar lice.  There are dozens of species and the delimitation of the genus has shifted much over time.",Answer the following question based on the context: Are Hippeastrum and Desmodium both genus of plants ?,

"Codenames is a 2015 board game designed by Vlaada Chvátil.  The game is typically for two teams of at least two players each, but can also be played by two or three players with just one person simply acting as the ""Spymaster"" (i.e. clue-giver) for the other one or two.  Rules for these variants are provided in the game instructions. Upwords (also branded as Scrabble Upwords in the United States and Canada, and Topwords Crucimaster, Betutorony, Palabras Arriba, Stapelwoord in other countries) is a board game invented by Elliot Rudell and originally published by the Milton Bradley Company, now a division of Hasbro.  The game remains under license to Hasbro by Rudell Design, LLC.  Upwords is similar to ""Scrabble"", or ""Words With Friends"", in that players build words using letter tiles on a gridded gameboard.  The point of difference is that in Upwords letters can be stacked on top of other letters already on the gameboard to create new words.  The higher the stack of letters, the more points are scored.  This typically makes words built in later turns of the game more valuable than earlier words, increasing play intensity and adding a level of strategy unique to Upwords.  The memorization of two-letter words is considered a useful skill in this game.",Answer the following question based on the context: Upwords and Codenames are both types of what?,

"Idle animations are animations within video games that occur when the player character is not performing any actions. They serve to give games personality, as an Easter Egg for the player, or for realism.

History 
One of the earliest games to feature an idle animation was Android Nim in 1978. The androids blink, look around, and seemingly talk to one another until the player gives an order. Another two early examples are Maziacs and The Pharaoh's Curse released in 1983. Idle animations grew in usage throughout the 16 bit era. Incorporating idle animations was done to give personality towards games and their characters  as they are the only in-game actions aside from cutscenes where the characters are free to act independent of the player's input.  The idle animation length and details can depend on interaction between the player and character, such as third person player idle animations are longer to avoid looking robotic on repeated viewing.  In modern 3D games idle animation are done to give realism. For games targeting towards younger audiences the idle animations are more likely to be complex or humorous. In comparison games targeted towards older audiences tend to include more basic idle animations.

Examples 

 Maziacs - The sprite character will tap his feet, blink, and sit down.
 Sonic the Hedgehog - Sonic will impatiently tap his foot when the player does not move.
 Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy Kong's Quest - Diddy Kong juggles a few balls after a few seconds without input.
 Super Mario 64 - Mario looks around and eventually will fall asleep.
 Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas - Carl ""CJ"" Johnson will sing songs including ""Nuthin' But A'G' Thang"" and ""My Lovin' (You're Never Gonna Get It).""
 Red Dead Redemption 2 - When left on a horse for a while Arthur Morgan will pet the horse.

"Ambrose of Alexandria (before 212 – c. 250) was a friend of the Christian theologian Origen. Ambrose was attracted by Origen's fame as a teacher, and visited the Catechetical School of Alexandria in 212.  At first a gnostic Valentinian and Marcionist, Ambrose, through Origen's teaching, eventually rejected this theology and became Origen's constant companion, and was ordained deacon. He plied Origen with questions, and urged him to write his Commentaries (treating him as """" in Commentary on John V,1) on the books of the Bible, and, as a wealthy nobleman and courtier, he provided his teacher with books for his studies and secretaries to lighten the labor of composition.

He suffered during the persecution under the Roman emperor Maximinus Thrax in 235. He was later released and died a confessor. The last mention of Ambrose in the historical record is in Origen's Contra Celsum, which the latter wrote at the solicitation of Ambrose.

Origen often speaks of Ambrose affectionately as a man of education with excellent literary and scholarly tastes. All of Origen's works written after 218 are dedicated to Ambrose, including his On Martyrdom, Contra Celsum, Commentary on St. John's Gospel, and On Prayer. Ambrose's letters to Origen (praised by Jerome) are lost, although part of one exists.

Veneration
Ambrose is venerated as a saint by some branches of Christianity. His feast day in the Catholic Church falls on 17 March.

"The English Mastiff is a breed of extremely large dog (often known simply as the Mastiff) perhaps descended from the ancient Alaunt and Pugnaces Britanniae, with a significant input from the Alpine Mastiff in the 19th century.  Distinguishable by enormous size, massive head, and a limited range of colours, but always displaying a black mask, the Mastiff is noted for its gentle and loving nature.  The lineage of modern dogs can be traced back to the early 19th century, but the modern type was stabilised in the 1880s and refined since.  Following a period of sharp decline, the Mastiff has increased its worldwide popularity.  Throughout its history, the Mastiff has contributed to the development of a number of dog breeds, some generally known as Mastiff-type dogs, or, confusingly, just as ""Mastiffs"". The Alpine Mastiff is an extinct Molosser dog breed, the progenitor of the St. Bernard, and a major contributor to the modern Mastiff (through such dogs as ""Couchez""), as well as to other breeds that derive from these breeds or are closely related to them.  M.B. Wynn wrote, ""In 1829 a vast light brindle dog of the old Alpine mastiff breed, named L'Ami, was brought from the convent of Great St. Bernard, and exhibited in London and Liverpool as the largest dog in England.""

The Pandikona is a primitive-type hunting dog from Pattikonda taluk-Kurnool district of Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh state, India.

"The bacon and egg pie is a savoury pie consisting of a crust containing bacon, egg and sometimes onion, mushrooms, bell peppers, peas, tomato, fresh herbs and cheese. It is popular in New Zealand. However, bacon and egg pie originated during the Middle Ages in Cornwall and is still a popular pie cooked in Cornish homes today (although rarely found in Cornish bakeries). For many Cornish people, a bacon and egg pie is more of a taste of home than the famous Cornish pasty.  Bacon and egg pie may be served with ketchup, which can be combined with Worcestershire sauce and drizzled over the filling before the pie is baked and some versions have a rising agent such as baking powder mixed into the egg to make a fluffier filling.

Composition
The pie is often constructed with shortcrust pastry or other stable base crust. The crust is usually topped with a pastry lid, but is sometimes left open.

A bacon and egg pie differs from a quiche, most notably due to the absence of cheese and milk and the presence of an upper crust. Also the eggs are not beaten and are whole, or at the most yolks pierced. The pie also tends to have a heavier texture and feel, and is generally high in calories.

Although the bacon and egg combination is not unique to any country, its use in modern cooking is notable in New Zealand, Canada and Australia. Recipes for it have been found as early as The Experienced English Housekeeper in 1769.

"Claro was a wapentake of the West Riding of Yorkshire, England.  It was split into two divisions.  The Upper Division included the parishes of Farnham, Fewston, Hampsthwaite, Kirkby Malzeard and Pannal and parts of Aldborough, Knaresborough, Otley, Little Ouseburn, Ripley, Ripon, Wetherby and Whixley, many of which formed exclaves.  The Lower Division included the parishes of Allerton Mauleverer, Goldsborough, Hunsingore, Kirk Deighton, Kirkby Overblow, Leathley, Spofforth with Stockeld, Weston and parts of Addingham, Aldborough, Harewood, Ilkley, Kirk Hammerton, Otley, Ripley and Whixley.

At the time of the Domesday Book the wapentake was known as Burghshire, named from its meeting place at Aldborough.  In the 12th century the name was changed to Claro, from Claro Hill near Coneythorpe, presumably its meeting place.

Claro wapentake is exceptional because it is one of the few hundreds or wapentakes to have divisions with exclaves. The historic reasons for the situation are obscure but are likely based on patterns of settlement and transportation.

The area of the wapentake now falls almost entirely within the district of Harrogate in North Yorkshire.

"The Tempest (Russian: Буря Burya), Symphonic Fantasia after Shakespeare, Op. 18, is a symphonic poem in F minor by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky composed in 1873. It was premiered in December 1873, conducted by Nikolai Rubinstein.

It is based on the play The Tempest by William Shakespeare.  Similar in structure to Tchaikovsky's better-known Romeo and Juliet fantasy-overture, it contains themes depicting the stillness of the ship at sea, the grotesque nature of Caliban, and the love between Ferdinand and Miranda.  The love music is particularly strong, being reminiscent of the love music from Romeo and Juliet.

Tchaikovsky was much influenced by Shakespeare: in addition to Romeo and Juliet and The Tempest, he also wrote a Hamlet overture-fantasy (1888) and incidental music to Hamlet (1891).

Excerpts from the score were used in the 2005 ballet Anna Karenina, choreographed by Boris Eifman.

"Perizoma flavofasciata, the sandy carpet or sandy rivulet, is a moth of the family Geometridae. The species was first described by Carl Peter Thunberg in 1792. It is found in most of Europe and northern Africa and east across the Palearctic to the Urals and the Altai Mountains. The species prefers meadow valleys, floodplains, waterside areas, bushy meadows and gardens. In the Alps it rises to 1500 metres.

Description
Its wingspan is 26–32 mm. The forewing is brownish-yellow or sandy with three toothed white transverse bands. The innermost is close to the base and rather narrow, the two outermost are wider and double (with a yellow-brown stripe in the middle). the outer white band is interrupted in the middle. Otherwise, the wings have several thin white transverse stripes, more or less complete, but the brownish-yellow ground colour predominates. The hind wing is white. The larva is pale pink with dark pink longitudinal stripes on either side of the dorsum. The area between the two longitudinal stripes is white. See also Prout.

Biology
The larvae of sandy carpet moths live in flowers and capsules of carnations (family Caryophyllaceae); in particular they feed on the seed pods of various campions (Silene species).
 
The flight period is from late May to early August. It is scarce and overwinters as a pupa.

"North Shore is an electoral district of the Legislative Assembly in the Australian state of New South Wales, located on Sydney's lower North Shore. It is currently held by  MP Felicity Wilson.

History
North Shore was originally created as a five-member electorate with the introduction of proportional representation in 1920, replacing Middle Harbour, Mosman, St Leonards and Willoughby and named after the North Shore of Sydney Harbour.  It was abolished in 1927 and replaced by Lane Cove, Manly, Mosman, Neutral Bay, North Sydney and Willoughby.  It was recreated in 1981, replacing Kirribilli.

It was originally expected to be a very safe Liberal seat; northern Sydney has been the power base for the Liberals and their predecessors for over a century.  However, it was held by independents from 1981 to 1991—most notably Ted Mack from 1981 to 1988.  The Liberals did not take the seat until 1991, but have held it with virtually no difficulty since then.

While  frequently runs dead in northern Sydney, North Shore is very unfriendly territory for Labor even by northern Sydney standards. Labor has never tallied more than 37 percent of the two-party vote. In the last four elections, Labor candidates have been pushed into third place, and have struggled to get to 20 percent of the primary vote.

"The Archbishopric of Riga (, ) was an archbishopric in Medieval Livonia, a subject to the Holy See. It was established in 1186 as the bishopric of Livonia at Ikšķile, then after moving to Riga it became the bishopric of Riga in 1202 and was elevated to an archbishopric in 1255.

Archbishops of Riga 

The archbishops of Riga were also the secular rulers of Riga until 1561 when during the Reformation the territory converted from Catholicism to Lutheranism and all church territories were secularized. The see was restored as a diocese of the Catholic Church in 1918 and raised into an archdiocese in 1923.

Bishops and Archbishops of Riga 

A new Bishopric of Livonia was established in Latgalia in 1621 during the Inflanty Voivodeship of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

Coinage 

The Archbishops of Riga were innovators in the field of minting currency, reviving techniques abandoned since the collapse of Rome. The names of individual archbishops after 1418, as well as the years of their respective reigns, are stamped on Livonian pennies excavated at archaeological sites. In many cases, this is the only biographical data available. No Livonian pennies before 1418 have been found.

"An anti-diarrhoeal drug (or anti-diarrheal drug in American English) is any medication which provides symptomatic relief for diarrhoea.

Types
 Electrolyte solutions, while not true antidiarrhoeals, are used to replace lost fluids and salts in acute cases.
 Bulking agents like methylcellulose, guar gum or plant fibre (bran, sterculia, isabgol, etc.) are used for diarrhoea in functional bowel disease and to control ileostomy output.
 Absorbents absorb toxic substances that cause infective diarrhoea, methylcellulose is an absorbent.
 Anti-inflammatory compounds such as bismuth subsalicylate.
 Anticholinergics reduce intestinal movement and are effective against both diarrhoea and accompanying cramping. 
 Opioids' classical use besides pain relief is as an anti-diarrhoeal drug. Opioids have agonist actions on the intestinal opioid receptors, which when activated cause constipation. Drugs such as morphine or codeine can be used to relieve diarrhoea this way. A notable opioid for the purpose of relief of diarrhoea is loperamide which is only an agonist of the μ opioid receptors in the large intestine and does not have opioid affects in the central nervous system as it doesn't cross the blood–brain barrier in significant amounts. This enables loperamide to be used to the same benefit as other opioid drugs but without the CNS side effects or potential for abuse.
Octreotide (somatostatin analogue) may be used in hospitalized patients to treat secretory diarrhea.

In 1920 Lachlan and Ashburnham were absorbed into Murrumbidgee and elected three members under proportional representation. At the end of proportional representation in 1927, Lachlan was recreated. It was abolished in 1950, recreated in 1981 and abolished in 2007.

The abolition of Lachlan for the 2007 election prompted its member, former Deputy Premier Ian Armstrong to retire at that election rather than seek the option of remaining in Parliament by contesting another seat.

Biography
Born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Corday graduated from the University of Alberta in 1930 and studied law before moving to the United States in 1934. He served as a Captain in the United States Army.

He worked in Broadway for many years before producing dramas for radio, such as Tortilla Flat, Tobacco Road, Gangbusters and Counterspy. He then moved to television in the 1950s, producing Guiding Light for a time as well as directing As the World Turns, from its 1956 premiere until 1965.

Corday was later lured to NBC to create three new soap operas. The first two, Paradise Bay and Morning Star, were not successful, but his third NBC serial, Days of Our Lives, was a success, and remains on the air as of 2023.

Death
Before Corday could pen many stories for the serial, he was diagnosed with cancer, and was admitted to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. After many months in the hospital, he died on July 23, 1966, aged 58. His widow, Betty Corday, continued to produce Days of our Lives until her death in 1987.

"Fielfraz was a Danish band, which had its heyday between 1990 and 1996. The band members were Claus Hempler on guitar and vocals, Nils Brakchi on bass, Kenneth Priisholm on guitar (lead) and Jens Langhorn on drums.

After several years of building up a live reputation in Odense, Fielfraz broke through with their very first record Shine, a Beatlesque guitar-oriented rock record. 1992's Electric Eel also included big radio hits like Surfer and Naked but the album as a whole was a lesser success. The third album, Slick, came late in 1996 and although widely critically acclaimed, it was largely ignored by the public.

Fielfraz continued to perform live occasionally, but Priisholm eventually left the band for good, leaving Fielfraz as a trio which released Hempler in 2004.

Fielfraz have been cited as an influence on Danish rock and grunge bands that broke through in the early 1990s like Kashmir and Dizzy Mizz Lizzy. However Fielfraz´ influences were primarily British; Priisholms guitar play was influenced by new wave like XTC and experimental rock like King Crimson and Claus Hemplers lyrics and vocal talent rendered Elvis Costello and Frank Sinatra, much more than hardcore punk and hard rock.

Fielfraz' time took place in a transitional period in the history of Danish rock, that broke the pop hegemony established by acts like Gnags, TV-2 and Sanne Salomonsen, in the 1980s. Alongside a few other British influenced 1990s acts like The Sandmen and Simcess, and the American influenced rock of D-A-D, they probably made the commercial breakthrough for the Danish grunge wave possibly in Denmark, by getting airplay on the dominating pop station, the national Danish radio (Danmarks Radio, P3).

"Davidson is an electoral district of the Legislative Assembly in the Australian state of New South Wales. It is represented by Matt Cross of the Liberal Party.

Covering parts of Sydney's Northern Beaches North Shore regions, it spills across portions of the Northern Beaches Council and Ku-ring-gai Council LGAs. It includes all of the namesake suburb of Davidson, as well as North Turramurra, St Ives, St Ives Chase, Killara, East Killara, Lindfield, East Lindfield, Roseville  and Roseville Chase.  It also includes parts of Turramurra, Belrose, Frenchs Forest, and Pymble.

Davidson includes portions of two of the most Liberal-supporting areas of Sydney, and has been in the hands of the Liberal Party for its entire existence. While  frequently runs dead in northern Sydney, Davidson is especially hostile territory for Labor. The only times that Labor has even remotely threatened the Liberals' hold on the seat came during the two ""Wranslides"" in 1978 and 1981, which were the only times that the Liberals have failed to win at least 60 percent of the two-party-preferred vote. However, even on those occasions, the Liberals won enough primary votes to retain the seat outright. Since the 1990s, Labor has been lucky to get 30 percent of the two-party-preferred vote, and has even been pushed into third place on some occasions.

"See Here, Private Hargrove (1942) is a book by Marion Hargrove, about his experiences in U.S. Army basic training.

Origin
The author, a North Carolina native, was a correspondent for The Charlotte News prior to World War II. After he was drafted in the U.S. Army, he wrote columns for the newspaper as a private at Fort Bragg. See Here, Private Hargrove is his collection of those columns, detailing his experiences in basic training with humor and sarcasm. 

See Here, Private Hargrove was a good-natured look at Army ways, its early portions making the Army seem like a boys' camp. Private Hargrove and his buddies irritated their sergeants endlessly but were punished with nothing worse than stints polishing garbage cans.

Success
The light-hearted book was a hit with readers, spending 15 weeks on the New York Times best-seller list. It was regarded as a ""publishing phenomenon,"" selling more than 400,000 hardcover copies, and more than two million copies in a paperback edition.

In 1944 the book was made into a movie of the same name, starring Robert Walker, Donna Reed, Keenan Wynn, Chill Wills and Robert Benchley. This was followed the next year by What Next, Corporal Hargrove?.

The book mentions fellow North Carolinian and journalist Lloyd Shearer, who later became a gossip columnist. It was said he ""gained some notoriety"" as a result of his appearance in the book.

"The Alexandrists were a school of Renaissance philosophers who, in the great controversy on the subject of personal immortality, adopted the explanation of the De Anima given by Alexander of Aphrodisias.

According to the orthodox Thomism of the Catholic Church, Aristotle rightly regarded reason as a facility of the individual soul. Against this, the Averroists, led by Agostino Nifo, introduced the modifying theory that universal reason in a sense individualizes itself in each soul and then absorbs the active reason into itself again.  These two theories respectively evolved the doctrine of individual and universal immortality, or the absorption of the individual into the eternal One.

The Alexandrists, led by Pietro Pomponazzi, assailed these beliefs and denied that either was rightly attributed to Aristotle.  They held that Aristotle considered the soul as a material and therefore a mortal entity which operates during life only under the authority of universal reason.  Hence the Alexandrists denied that Aristotle viewed the soul as immortal, because in their view, since they believed that Aristotle viewed the soul as organically connected with the body, the dissolution of the latter involves the extinction of the former.

"The American Prairie Foundation is a public charity located in the U.S. state of Montana.  The foundation's objective is to build one of the largest wildlife reserves in the continental United States through a combination of new land acquisition and public land integration into the project, called the American Prairie Reserve.  To accomplish this, the foundation estimates that it must acquire 500000 acre privately, which would then link together over 3000000 acre of existing public property.  The Charles M.

Before he joined Yale, Tompkins had also built the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee into a national soccer power. It was announced in August that 2014 would be his last year coaching, and that he would be moving into the administration following the season.
 
He was born in London, England, and first went to the United States in 1980 as a part of a summer exchange program working with inner-city children. He returned for several summers and later became an assistant boys' soccer coach at Homestead High School in Mequon, Wisconsin, under coach Bob Gansler. In 1999, as head coach of Varsity Soccer at Yale, Tompkins lead the Bulldogs to a school-record 13 wins, an appearance in the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 1991 and a final national ranking of 18th.

Tompkins has done charitable work for several organizations. He organized a soccer/reading camp for underprivileged children, volunteered for the Midwest Athletes Against Childhood Cancer Fund and worked at Camp Heartland, a camp for young AIDS victims in Wisconsin.

"The anthophytes are a paraphyletic grouping of plant taxa bearing flower-like reproductive structures. The group, once thought to be a clade, contained the angiosperms - the extant flowering plants, such as roses and grasses - as well as the Gnetales and the extinct Bennettitales.

Detailed morphological and molecular studies have shown that the group is not actually monophyletic, with proposed floral homologies of the gnetophytes and the angiosperms having evolved in parallel.  This makes it easier to reconcile molecular clock data that suggests that the angiosperms diverged from the gymnosperms around 320-300 mya.

Some more recent studies have used the word anthophyte to describe a hypothetical group which includes the angiosperms and a variety of extinct seed plant groups (with various suggestions including at least some of the following groups: glossopterids, corystosperms, Petriellales Pentoxylales, Bennettitales and Caytoniales), but not the Gnetales.

"PKP class OKl27 is a class of ordinary passenger (O) tank (K) 2-6-2 (l) steam locomotives designed in 1927 for Polskie Koleje Państwowe (Polish State Railways, PKP). It was the first completely Polish construction. The design was prepared by eng. Bryling.

History

Production
Hipolit Cegielski Metal Works in Poznań produced 122 engines in the period of 1928–1933.

Operation
The OKl27 class serviced mainly local transport, especially suburban lines.

Wartime
After the German invasion of Poland in World War II, 107 of the 122 OKl27 locomotives were taken into the Deutsche Reichsbahn fleet as 75 1201 to 75 1307. The remaining 15 were taken into the stock of the Soviet Railways; all but two of which came into German hands and were renumbered 75 1308 to 75 1320.

After the war, most locomotives were restored to Poland and renumbered. While the post-war class remained the same, locomotives were renumbered at random, so a locomotive's pre- and post war identities are (usually) completely different.

Preservation
Four engines have survived: 
OKl27-10 in Skierniewice (as an exhibit), 
OKl27-26 in Warsaw Railroad Museum (as an exhibit), 
OKl27-27 in Gdynia (as an exhibit), and 
OKl27-41 in Chabówka.

"Rebelde was a Mexican comic book series, published by now defunct Ka-Boom! Estudio, based on the telenovela of the same title. The comic was first published April 2006 and lasted only two issues due to conflicts caused by Ka-Boom's writers. Despite initial demand being high, the amateur writing team from Ka-Boom delivered the scripts for the first three issues months later than agreed, causing the art team trouble and also creating conflicts with Televisa's editorial representatives, which led to the cancellation of the title.
 
The series was advertised as being based on the style of Japanese manga, but it was only partially based on it. 

The creative team was formed by Rebeca Soriano as writer, with art duties provided (in the 2 published issues) by Jorge Reséndiz, inks by Eridan Zumaya and color by Guillermo Piña; writing direction by Susana Romero; art direction by Oscar González Guerrero, and the direction and editing of the project by Oscar González Loyo.

Reception
The book's first issue sold well, but the delay between the first and the second issues caused sales to drop tremendously. 
The art received praise as the faux anime style was popular during the time of print, while the script was heavily criticized by fans to the original TV show as being poorly characterized and too disconnected from the original source.

Trivia
This was Rebeca Soriano's only writing credit; she retired after this in order to work as a housemaid taking care of an elderly couple.

"Thermal physics is the combined study of thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and kinetic theory of gases.  This umbrella-subject is typically designed for physics students and functions to provide a general introduction to each of three core heat-related subjects.  Other authors, however, define thermal physics loosely as a summation of only thermodynamics and statistical mechanics.
Thermal physics can be seen as the study of system with larger number  of atom,  it unites thermodynamics to statistical mechanics.

Overview
Thermal physics, generally speaking, is the study of the statistical nature of physical systems from an energetic perspective.  Starting with the basics of heat and temperature, thermal physics analyzes the first law of thermodynamics and second law of thermodynamics from the statistical perspective, in terms of the number of microstates corresponding to a given macrostate.  In addition, the concept of entropy is studied via quantum theory.

A central topic in thermal physics is the canonical probability distribution.  The electromagnetic nature of photons and phonons are studied which show that the oscillations of electromagnetic fields and of crystal lattices have much in common.  Waves form a basis for both, provided one incorporates quantum theory.

Other topics studied in thermal physics include: chemical potential, the quantum nature of an ideal gas, i.e. in terms of fermions and bosons, Bose–Einstein condensation, Gibbs free energy, Helmholtz free energy, chemical equilibrium, phase equilibrium, the equipartition theorem, entropy at absolute zero, and transport processes as mean free path, viscosity, and conduction.

"Negroid (also known as Congoid) is a grouping of human beings historically regarded as a biological taxon.  The term has been used by forensic and physical anthropologists to refer to individuals and populations that share certain morphological and skeletal traits that are frequent among populations in most of Sub-Saharan Africa and isolated parts of Southeast Asia (Negritos).  First introduced in early racial science and anthropometry, ""Negroid"" denoted one of the three purported major races of humankind (alongside Caucasoid and Mongoloid).  Many social scientists have argued that such analyses are rooted in sociopolitical and historical processes rather than in empirical observation.  However, ""Negroid"" as a biological classification remains in use in forensic anthropology. In Brazil, a sarará (] or ] ) is a multiracial person, being a particular kind of ""mulato"" or ""juçara"" (a tri-racial pardo with Amerindian features), with perceivable Negroid facial features, light complexion and fair but curly hair, called ""cabelo crespo"", or fair but Afro-like frizzly hair, called ""carapinha"", ""cabelo encarapinhado"" or ""cabelo pixaim"" (] ).

"Sugar glass (also called candy glass, edible glass, and breakaway glass) is a brittle transparent form of sugar that looks like glass. It can be formed into a sheet that looks like flat glass or an object, such as a bottle or drinking glass.

Description
Sugar glass is made by dissolving sugar in water and heating it to at least the ""hard crack"" stage (approx. 150 °C / 300 °F) in the candy making process.  Glucose or corn syrup is used to prevent the sugar from recrystallizing, by getting in the way of the sugar molecules forming crystals. Cream of tartar also helps by turning the sugar into glucose and fructose.

Because sugar glass is hygroscopic, it must be used soon after preparation, or it will soften and lose its brittle quality.

Sugar glass has been used to simulate glass in movies, photographs, plays and professional wrestling.

Other uses 
Sugar glass is also used to make sugar sculptures or other forms of edible art.

Sugar glass with blue dye was used to represent the methamphetamine in the AMC TV series Breaking Bad. Actor Aaron Paul would eat it on set.

"Saint Sabinian of Troyes (died 275) was a pagan who converted to Christianity (tradition states that he was converted by Patroclus of Troyes), and became a martyr under Aurelian. He was beheaded at Rilly-Sainte-Syre near Troyes.

His feast day is 29 January.

Legend

Legend has it that Saint Fiacre's sister Syra came to join him in France and became a nun. She was blind, but as John O'Hanlon relates, ""Through his merits, St. Fiacre had an inspiration, that his sister should recover her sight, while to her in like manner was revealed the spot where the body of St. Savinien lay. There, prostrating herself, she poured forth her soul in prayer, and her face bedewed with tears, she would not rise from the ground until her petition was heard. She was restored miraculously to the use of vision.""

"C. Malcolm Parry (born c. 1938) is a Welsh architect, professor emeritus, and TV/radio broadcaster.

Early life
Parry was born in Blaenavon, left school at the age of 15 and trained as a Mining Surveyor. He intended to attend university to study Civil Engineering but was encouraged by the then Head of Architecture at Cardiff University to study architecture. Parry was later employed by the university to teach and carry out research.

Employment at Cardiff University
Parry is a former Head of the Welsh School of Architecture at Cardiff University, which he led from 1997 until his retirement. In his teachings Parry showed a particular interest in the aspect of light in architecture, evident in the Architectural Practice Group of which he was director. The research group studies the processes of architectural design, including construction law, economics, process and the strategic management of estates. The group has links with the RIBA. Research into the design process includes the production of a Design Manual for Wales.

TV appearances
Parry has presented several programmes about architecture on BBC television, for example On the House, as well as BBC Radio Wales programmes Building on the Past and Work Matter.

In 1999 he devised and progressed The House for the Future project in conjunction with the BBC, which resulted in a TV series about the construction of the building, which he presented.

In the first series of Building on the Past, Parry visited the towns of Newport, Newtown, Blaenavon, Carmarthen, Criccieth and Machynlleth, and in the second series Anglesey, Swansea, Presteigne, Lampeter, Merthyr, and Haverfordwest, relating the history of each town to its architecture.

"""Unwashed and Somewhat Slightly Dazed"" is a song by English musician David Bowie, released on his 1969 album David Bowie. It was one of the first songs produced by Tony Visconti.

Inspiration 
In July 1969, Bowie performed at the Maltese Music Festival while his father became sick and later died. The feel of the song was meant to show Bowie's feelings after his father's death.

The song also seems to be about social structure, as the girl in the song is very wealthy compared to the narrator. Bowie said that the song was written because he got ""funny stares"" from people.

Song structure 
The song opens with acoustic Asus2 and D9 chords. This repeats until the song enters the main structure, a new beat with guitars and harmonica. This part of the song mainly switches between C and F, but occasionally uses other chords as well. After the lyrics finish, the music continues for about two minutes before ending.

Review after ""Blackstar"" 
After the release of ""Blackstar"" and the death of David Bowie, several lists were created that cited ""Unwashed and Somewhat Slightly Dazed"" as an important song in Bowie's history. Rolling Stone says that the song is ""pretty unremarkable except for one thing: It's the first Tony Visconti-produced David Bowie track the world ever heard."" Hillary E. Crawford shares this opinion, only including it because ""This track, which immediately follows ""Space Oddity,"" was the first to be produced by Tony Visconti, the man who also produced Bowie's last album Blackstar.""

Personnel 
According to Chris O'Leary:

David Bowie – lead vocal
Keith Christmas – 12-string acoustic guitar
Mick Wayne – lead guitar
Tim Renwick – rhythm guitar
John Lodge – bass
John Cambridge – drums
Benny Marshall – harmonica
Unknown musicians – saxophones, trumpets
Tony Visconti – producer

"Whortle's Hope is a dark fantasy novel for children by British author Robin Jarvis. It is the second book in The Deptford Mouselets series, prequels to Jarvis's Deptford Mice trilogy aimed at a slightly younger audience. It was first published in the United Kingdom in 2007. The story focuses on Whortle Nep, a fieldmouse who was a minor character in The Crystal Prison, and is set a year prior to that book's events.

Synopsis
In the story, which takes place in the summer before the events of The Crystal Prison, it is almost the time of the Fennywolde games, when the young field mice compete to see who will have the honour of being the head sentry of the cornfield for the entire summer. Young Whortle longs to win the competition, but not if it means his friends are going to sabotage the other competitor's chances. He wants to win on his own merits, but soon realises winning isn't the most important thing as another mouse needs the prize more than he does.

Reception
John Lloyd of The Bookbag gave Whortle's Hope a five star review, calling it ""an essential addition to the bookshelves of anybody who has read Robin Jarvis before, and despite filling in blanks elsewhere in the series for fans, it really works as an initial launch into the rest.""

"Frond dimorphism refers to a difference in ferns between the fertile and sterile fronds.  Since ferns, unlike flowering plants, bear spores on the leaf blade itself, this may affect the form of the frond itself.  In some species of ferns, there is virtually no difference between the fertile and sterile fronds, such as in the genus ""Dryopteris"", other than the mere presence of the sori, or fruit-dots, on the back of the fronds.  Some other species, such as ""Polystichum acrostichoides"" (Christmas fern), or some ferns of the genus ""Osmunda"", feature dimorphism on a portion of the frond only.  Others, such as some species of ""Blechnum"" and ""Woodwardia"", have fertile fronds that are markedly taller than the sterile.  Still others, such as ""Osmunda cinnamomea"" (Cinnamon fern), or plants of the family Onocleaceae, have fertile fronds that are completely different from the sterile. Alonsoa (Mask flower) is a genus of 12 species of flowering plants in the family Scrophulariaceae, the figwort family.  The genus includes both herbaceous and shrubby species. Dryopteris crassirhizoma is a fern species in the genus ""Dryopteris"".  It is an element (Traditional: 貫眾, Simplified: 贯众) of the Yupingfeng Asian soup formulation derivative. Dryopteris , commonly called wood fern, male fern (referring in particular to ""Dryopteris filix-mas""), or buckler fern, is a genus of about 250 species of ferns with distribution in Eastern Asia, the Americas, Europe, Africa, and the Pacific islands, with the highest species diversity in eastern Asia.  Many of the species have stout, slowly creeping rootstocks that form a crown, with a vase-like ring of fronds.  The sori are round, with a peltate indusium.  The stipes have prominent scales.","Answer the following question based on the context: Which is a genus of more species, Dryopteris or Alonsoa?",

"Mehrab Hossain (; born 22 September 1978) is a Bangladeshi cricketer who played in 9 Test matches and 18 One Day Internationals from 1998 to 2003. 

He became the first Bangladeshi cricketer to score a century in ODIs when he scored 101 against Zimbabwe at Bangabandhu National Stadium at Dhaka in 1999. 

Mehrab is associated with an extremely unfortunate incident. On 20 February 1998, Raman Lamba, formerly a Delhi swashbuckling opening batsman, fielding close to the bat, copped one on the skull off the bat of Mehrab Hossain. Lamba died of the injury later in the day. Mehrab was deeply affected by the incident and took a spell off the game. He came back later to play for Bangladesh.

"Spring Song (in Swedish: ; in Finnish: ), Op. 16, is a single-movement tone poem for orchestra written in 1894 by the Finnish composer Jean Sibelius.

History
The piece was initially composed as Improvisation for Orchestra, in the key of D major. It premiered on 21 July 1894 at an outdoor festival in Vaasa, organized by the  (). Short, lyrical, and delicately scored, Sibelius's piece was ill-suited for the open-air concert, and the audience received it less enthusiastically than another work on the program: Korsholm, by Sibelius's brother-in-law and friend Armas Järnefelt. Shortly therefore, Sibelius withdrew Improvisation for revision. In 1895, he recast it in F major and retitled the work Spring Song (), appending the subtitle ""The Sadness of Spring"" to that (unpublished) version.

Structure
The work is scored for 2 flutes (both doubling piccolo), 2 oboes, 2 clarinets (in B), 2 bassoons, 4 horns (in F), 3 trumpets (in F), 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, glocken, violins, violas, cellos and double basses. Spring Song takes about 8 minutes to play.

The tempo marking is: Tempo moderato e sostenuto. The piece contains an optimism that is relatively rare among Sibelius' works. It is known for its prominent use of bells at the end of the song.

"The Revenge of Al Capone (also known as ""Capone"") is a 1989 American television film about Al Capone starring Keith Carradine as Michael Rourke.  The plot is not based on fact but rather is based on a revisionist interpretation of the 1933 attempted murder of President-elect Roosevelt by delusional anarchist Giuseppe Zangara. S.S.C. Napoli endured a horror season, which was to be the last for the second incarnation of the club.  The target prior to the season was promotion to Serie A, and several experienced players were brought in to achieve that goal, among them Massimo Carrera, Renato Olive, Rubens Pasino and Gianluca Savoldi.  Especially the signing of Savoldi was significant, since he is the son of legendary Napoli striker Giuseppe Savoldi.  Even though the club lost captain Roberto Stellone to Reggina, its chances to be promoted were seen as rather good. Giuseppe ""Joe"" Zangara (September 7, 1900 – March 20, 1933) was the assassin of Anton Cermak, the Mayor of Chicago.  Zangara was an Italian American anarchist who shot Cermak and four others in Miami, Florida, on February 15, 1933, during a night speech by United States President–elect Franklin D. Roosevelt.

"Rhodogune (; 2nd century BCE)  was a queen of the Seleucid Empire by marriage to Demetrius II Nicator. She was the daughter of the Parthian king Mithridates I (171 BCE-132 BCE), and sister of Phraates II (ruled 132 BCE-127 BCE).

Life

In 138 BCE Rhodogune married Seleucid King Demetrius II Nicator (ruled 146-139 BCE, 129-126 BCE). They were kept by her brother in Hyrcania on the shores of the Caspian Sea, during which time they had several children. During their marriage, Demetrius was temporarily a hostage in the Parthian court after an ill-fated campaign in Babylonia.

Polyaenus wrote that Rhodogune, informed of a revolt while preparing for a bath, vowed not to bathe or brush her hair until the revolt was quashed. She immediately went into battle, riding out to the head of her army. She defeated the rebels, and was depicted thereafter on seals of the kings of Persia with long, disheveled hair because of her adherence to her vow. This incident is also mentioned in the anonymously written Tractatus de mulieribus, which elaborates further on the story, describing her as being depicted with a golden statue showing her hair half-braided, half unbraided.

She was presumably abandoned in 129 BCE when Demetrius, after numerous failed attempts to escape from Parthia, was dispatched back to Antioch during the invasion of Parthia by Demetrius's brother, Antiochus VII Sidetes.

"Aedesius (, died 355 AD) was a Neoplatonist philosopher and mystic. He was born into a wealthy Cappadocian family, but he moved to Syria, where he was apprenticed to Iamblichos. None of his writings have survived, but there is an extant biography by Eunapius, a Greek sophist and historian of the 4th century who wrote a collection of biographies titled Lives of the Sophists. Aedesius's philosophical doctrine was a mixture between Platonism and eclecticism and, according to Eunapius, he differed from Iamblichus on certain points connected with theurgy and magic. 

The school of Syria was dispersed after Iamblichus' death, and Aedesius seems to have modified his doctrines out of fear of Constantine II, and took refuge in divination. An oracle in hexameter verse represented a pastoral life as his only retreat, but his disciples, perhaps calming his fears by a metaphorical interpretation, compelled him to resume his instructions. Aedesius then founded a school of philosophy at Pergamon, which emphasized theurgy and the revival of polytheism, and where he numbered among his pupils Eusebius of Myndus, Maximus of Ephesus, and the Roman emperor Julian. After the accession of the latter to the imperial purple he invited Aedesius to continue his instructions, but the declining strength of the sage being unequal to the task, two of his most learned disciples, Chrysanthius and the aforementioned Eusebius, were by his own desire appointed to supply his place. His co-teacher and perhaps consort at the Pergamon school was the female philosopher and mystic, Sosipatra.

"Bedburg-Hau is a municipality in the district of Kleve in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. It is located approximately 5 km south-east of Kleve.

One of its main attractions is Museum Schloss Moyland, a castle with a museum of modern art dedicated to the German artist Joseph Beuys. The park around the castle has a sculpture garden, herbal gardens and a rose garden. Castle Moyland was first documented in 1307. In the 1740s Frederick of Prussia used the castle to meet with a lover of his. In 1766 it came into possession of the von Steengracht family, and it remained in their possession until 1990 when the foundation Stiftung Museum Schloss Moyland was formed to care for it.

Once a medieval moated castle, the Castle was converted to its current appearance in the 19th century by Cologne Cathedral architect Ernst Friedrich Zwirner, who transformed it in the Gothic Revival style. After being heavily damaged in World War II, it was only after the foundation was established that a comprehensive restoration was initiated, allowing the castle to serve its current purpose. The museum was opened in 1995. The reconstruction of Moyland Schloss was finally completed in 2007 with a topping ceremony when a replica of the historical spire was placed on top of the northtower.

Bedburg-Hau is also home to St. Markus Church, which was built in 1124, and the mausoleum where Prince John Maurice von Nassau-Siegen was initially buried before his bodily remnants were brought to Siegen.

A large area near the railway station is dedicated territory of the mental hospital LVR-Klinik Bedburg-Hau. The terrain was established around 1910, and now has many architectural monuments.

Villages within the municipality of Bedburg-Hau are Hau, Hasselt, Huisberden, Louisendorf, Schneppenbaum, Till-Moyland and Qualburg.

Career
Oh Dal-su began his acting career in theater in Busan, and since 2001 has been the head of theater company Singiru Manhwagyeong (""Mirage and Kaleidoscope""). His rich experience on the stage, in local productions such as Ogu, later made Oh an in-demand supporting/character actor on the big screen.

Oh has starred in numerous successful films, in roles such as the owner of the organized crime-funded private jail in Oldboy (2003), a former gang boss in Mapado (2005), a weapons smuggler in A Bittersweet Life (2005), a transvestite in Foxy Festival (2010), a Chinese-Korean conman in The Thieves (2012), and a sympathetic inmate in Miracle in Cell No. 7. He also dubbed the voice of the monster in The Host (2006).

Sexual harassment allegations
On 22 February 2018, Oh was accused of sexual harassment. He denied the accusation. On 26 February, further accusations against Oh were broadcast on JTBC Newsroom, during an interview with a woman who accused Oh of sexual harassment and sexual assault. The following day, actress Uhm Ji-young came forward in JTBC's Newsroom, saying that she was also sexually harassed by Oh in 2003. As a result, Oh pulled out of his upcoming TV series My Mister. On 28 February, he admitted to sexual abuse and apologized to the victims.

In March 2018, Oh was dropped from Along with the Gods: The Two Worlds cast. In June, it was reported that the release of three films that Oh has starred in; I Want to Know Your Parents, Good Neighbor, and Control, has been postponed indefinitely.

"The Violin Sonata No. 5 in F major, Op. 24, is a four movement work for violin and piano by Ludwig van Beethoven. It was first published in 1801.  The work is commonly known as the Spring Sonata (Frühlingssonate), although the name ""Spring"" was apparently given to it after Beethoven's death.  The sonata was dedicated to Count Moritz von Fries, a patron to whom Beethoven also dedicated two other works of the same year—the String Quintet in C major, Op. 29 and the Violin Sonata No. 4—as well as his later Symphony No. 7 in A major.

The autograph manuscript of the sonata is preserved in the Austrian National Library.

Origin
Beethoven initially intended to pair this work with his Violin Sonata No. 4, Opus 23, and the two sonatas complement each other in both key and character.  However, the two were not published together and thus have different opus numbers. The reason for the separation is unknown.

Structure 
The work is in four movements:

The entire sonata takes approximately 22 minutes to perform.

They are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and southern Africa and tropical Asia.  Coffee ranks as one of the world's most valuable and widely traded commodity crops and is an important export product of several countries, including those in Central and South America, the Caribbean and Africa. Cobaea is a genus of flowering plants including about 20 species of rapid growing, ornamental climbers native to Mexico.  The botanical name honors Father Bernabé Cobo, Spanish Jesuit of the seventeenth century, naturalist, and resident of America for many years.  The woody stems can reach 20 ft .  Leaves are alternate lobed with opposite pairs and tendrils.  In late summer to early spring, the large, bell-shaped flowers are borne profusely and singly along the stems with bright green, violet, or purple in colors.

"Shishunaga (IAST: Śiśunāga, or Shusunaga) ( – 395 BCE) was the founder of the Shishunaga dynasty of the Magadha Empire in the present day northern India. Initially, he was an amatya (official) of the Magadha empire under the Haryanka dynasty. He was placed on the throne by the people who revolted against the Haryanka dynasty rule. According to the Puranas, he placed his son at Varanasi and himself ruled from Girivraja (Rajagriha). He was succeeded by his son Kalashoka (Kakavarna).

Early life
According to the Mahavamsatika, Shishunaga was a son of a Licchavi ruler of Vaishali. He was conceived by a nagara-shobhini and brought up an officer of state. At the time of the revolt, he was a viceroy at Varanasi of king Nagadasaka, the last ruler of the Haryanka dynasty.

Reign
Shishunaga ruled from 413 BCE to 395 BCE. Initially, his capital was Rajagriha and Vaishali was his second royal residence. Later he shifted his capital to Vaishali. He conquered Avanti kingdom by defeating Nandivardhana or Avantivardhana, the last king of Pradyota dynasty. The Magadhan victory must have been helped by the revolution that placed Aryaka on the throne of Ujjayini.

The Puranas tell us that he placed his son at Varanasi and himself ruled from Girivraja (Rajagriha).

Expansion
He destroyed Pradyota dynasty of Avanti and conquered kingdoms of Kosala and Vatsa.

Successor
He was succeeded by his son Kalashoka (Kakavarna).

"Eynesil is a town in Giresun Province on the Black Sea coast of Turkey, east of the city of Giresun, towards Trabzon. It is the seat of Eynesil District. Its population is 7,083 (2022).

History

Antiquity
The history of the area dates back to the Hittites in 1500BC, followed by the Phrygians in 1200BC. The Ancient Greeks arrived in 765 BC and in 670BC a colony of the Aegean Greek community of Miletos was founded, one of a chain of 90 trading posts along the Black Sea coast. By 520 BC Eynesil was in the territory of the Satrap of Pontus, a territory of the Persian Empire. This was succeeded by the Roman Empire and the Byzantines and in 1204 the Empire of Trebizond, a rump-Byzantine state that lasted until it was overthrown by Sultan Mehmet II of the Ottoman Empire in 1461.

During the medieval period one of the most important guardians of the coastal road connecting Trabzon to Samsun was the large Byzantine garrison fort located about 3 kilometers east of modern town of Eynesil.  An archaeological and historical assessment of this site as well as a scaled plan were published in 1985.  The impressive circuit walls and defenses create two separate baileys with the remains of numerous rooms.  The site briefly served as a Russian military depot and lighthouse (1877–78) during the Russo-Turkish War.  Today it has become a popular tourist attraction.

The Turkish era
In December 1461 Eynesil became part of the Ottoman Empire, and the first Turkish people to move into the area were the Chepni, followers of Haji Bektash Veli and therefore responsible for the strength of the Alevi community in Eynesil.

The majority of the species are native to the Americas and Asia. Colada morada (Spanish for ""dark purple strained"") is a traditional Ecuadorian beverage prepared with black corn flour and fruits such as naranjilla, babaco, pineapple, blackberries, strawberries, and blueberries (which give it its color).  The drink is sweetened with cane sugar, known as p""anela"", and prepared with spices such as cinnamon, allspice, cloves and herbs such as lemongrass and lemon verbena.  It is traditionally consumed on November 2, All Souls' Day, with a type of bread called ""t'anta wawa"" which are bread figures shaped like babies and often decorated with colorful icing and filled with fruit jam (strawberry or guava). Citharexylum berlandieri is a species of flowering plant in the verbena family, Verbenaceae, that is native to the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas in the United States and Mexico as far south as Oaxaca.  Common names include Tamaulipan fiddlewood, Berlandier fiddlewood, negrito fiddlewood, negrito, and orcajuela.  It is a shrub or small tree, reaching a height of 6 m .

"Exocet is a typeface designed by the British typographer Jonathan Barnbrook for the Emigre foundry in 1991. It was originally designed for the European annual series Illustration Now.

The font is inspired by ancient incised Greek and Roman letter carvings, with geometric shapes used for the main construction. For example, its stylized Q is based on qoppa, an ancient form of Q. The O with a cross () is an early form of theta.

It is an all-capital font, but with different capital glyphs for both lowercase and capital letters. However, the only letter that has visually distinct forms is T, with the lowercase t being a cross.

Variants

It is available in ""light"" and ""heavy"" varieties. There is no italic.

A sans version of the font from the same designer, called Patriot, was released in 1997.

Notable uses

It was used extensively for product designs in the 1990s, most notably for the American tea company Tazo. It was also used on the album cover of Donald Fagen's 1993 album Kamakiriad. It can be seen in the 1993 movie Demolition Man where it is used extensively in the museum scene. It was also used in the film Dogma, the film Star Trek Nemesis, the Dungeons & Dragons campaign setting Planescape, the English translation of the Korean manhwa Priest, the Diablo computer game series, the Double Switch full motion video game, and the Sony PlayStation scrolling shooter game Einhänder.

"Erbaa is a town in Tokat Province in the Black Sea region of Turkey. It is the seat of Erbaa District. Its population is 75,210 (2022). The town of Erbaa lies on the left bank of the Kelkit River and is surrounded by the Erbaa Plain, most of which lies in its district.

One kilometer east-southeast of Erbaa is the archaeological site of Horoztepe.

Etymology
The name ""Erbaa"" means ""four"" in Arabic. According to the official records of the Ottoman Empire, this name started to be used beginning from the early 18th century. The name was also used as ""Nevah-i Erbaa"", which literally means ""four towns"". It refers to the period when the most important settlements between Niksar and Amasya, namely Erek, Karayaka, Sonusa (Uluköy), and Taşâbat (Taşova) were collectively named as Nevah-i Erbaa or ""four towns"" as they were in the same region and close to one another. Even the accrued taxes of the time were recorded in this name. In 1840, the taxes collected from these four towns were registered to be 47,243 kuruş.

Erbaa came to be used as a general name for Erek, Karayaka, Sonusa, and Taşâbat and was regarded as a district. The name Kaza-i Erbaa, or Erbaa District was also used during the Ottoman Empire. As the town of Erek developed more than the others over time, it became a district in 1872 and took the name Erbaa on its own and the others, Taşâbat, Karayaka and Sonusa became the villages of Erek, or today's Erbaa. Later, in 1944, when Taşabat or today's Taşova became a separate district in 1944, Sonusa was also annexed to Taşova.

Biography 
The project began circa 2004 when three active members of Finland's metal scene decided to create a grindcore and brutal death side project. Pasi Koskinen and Niclas Etelävuori, ex-bandmates from Amorphis, joined Mika Karppinen (aka Gas) who is in the gothic rock band HIM.

The band released their first EP in 2004, For Those About to Rot (a play on AC/DC's For Those About to Rock We Salute You).

It is considered a holy island, and only monks of the Ethiopian Church live there.

The monks believe that the island was once the resting place of the Ark of the Covenant. According to tradition, the Ark was placed there by Emperor Ezana, the first Ethiopian sovereign to convert to Christianity, and it remained on the island until it was transported to Mary of Zion church in Axum.

Graham Hancock has speculated that the Ark was carried from Elephantine by the Jewish garrison on the island, around the 5th century BC. However, some specialists consider the theory unfounded.

When R.E. Cheesman visited Tana Qirqos in 1933, he found a large stratum of rock at the northern end of the island, which looked ""like a huge wall of masonry"" 400 or 500 yards long and standing about 100 feet high. He recorded that the formation ""has been identified as olivine-bearing basalt,"" and that ""in all probability the island gives its name to the lake.""

"Anthonius Josephus Maria ""Toon"" Leeuwenberg (11 August 1930 in Amsterdam – 2010) was a Dutch botanist and taxonomist best known for his research into the genus ""Buddleja"" at the Laboratory of Plant Taxonomy and Plant Geography, Wageningen.  He was responsible for sinking many Asiatic species as varieties, notably within ""Buddleja crispa"".  In 1962, he worked with Jan de Wilde on the flora of the Ivory Coast. Buddleja delavayi is a Chinese species discovered by Forrest in the Tali Range above Dali (2000 – 2500 m elevation), Yunnan, in 1910; it is also found in Xizang (Tibet).  The species was named for l'Abbé Delavay, the French missionary and plant collector, by Gagnepain in 1912.  The shrub is of interest to the botanist because of its unique (within the genus) resting buds and the different types of inflorescence produced through the year. Koelreuteria is a genus of three species of flowering plants in the family Sapindaceae, native to southern and eastern Asia. Buddleja, or Buddleia (also historically given as ""Buddlea""), commonly known as the butterfly bush, is a genus comprising over 140 species of flowering plants endemic to Asia, Africa, and the Americas.  The generic name bestowed by Linnaeus posthumously honoured the Reverend Adam Buddle (1662–1715), an English botanist and rector, at the suggestion of Dr. William Houstoun.  Houstoun sent the first plants to become known to science as buddleja (""B. americana"") to England from the Caribbean about 15 years after Buddle's death.","Answer the following question based on the context: Which genus has more species, Buddleja or Koelreuteria?",
"Sinanpaşa (or Sincanlı) is a town of Afyonkarahisar Province, Turkey on a plain surrounded by pine-covered mountains, 33 km from the city of Afyon on the road to Uşak and İzmir. It is the seat of Sinanpaşa District. Its population is 3,544 (2021). The mayor is Erdal Karaman (AKP).

Winters are cold and snowy, and summers are dry and hot.

History
The area has been a crossroads since antiquity, with archaeological evidence indicating habitation since 4000 BC. Surface excavations in the village of Küçükhöyük go back to 3000 BC.

The name Sinan Paşa comes from the son of a lord of the Akkoyunlu Turks who in 1473 took refuge with Ottoman Sultan Mehmet II during the war between the Akkoyunlu and the warrior Uzun Hasan (the Otlukbeli War). Later in the Ottoman period the important general Hersekzade Ahmet Paşa settled here in the village still known as Ahmet Paşa today.

The town was occupied by Greek forces during the Turkish War of Independence, but was recovered during the great Turkish counter-attack in 1922.

Sinanpaşa today
Nowadays Sinanpaşa is a country town providing schools, hospital and other infrastructure to the surrounding countryside, where poppy seeds, wheat and other grains are grown.

"Some Australian state schools, both primary and high, are supported by parents and citizens' associations also known as PCA or P&C. These groups provide volunteer support, raise funds for infrastructure and other expenses and assist in the administration of their school.

A large part of many P&C activities is the provision of subsidies to school excursions and other supplemental and extracurricular activities.

P&Cs encourage the general public and local businesses to become involved with their local schools.

Recent years have seen a number of changes to the environment in which P&Cs operate.
Volunteers sometimes require blue cards (criminal record checks) if they do not have children in the related school.
Tuckshops and fundraisers are required to sell only healthy foods.
Education Queensland has devolved many costs onto the school communities that were previously covered by the department. This has led to some schools requiring a ""voluntary"" payment from parents to cover consumables.

In Victoria, School Councils are similar to P&Cs, although they also have a more formal role in helping to manage the school.

"The Medellín River (), called Porce River () during most of its course, is a river that flows through the Colombian city of Medellín and its metropolitan area. For many years an organization called Mi Río (My River) was involved in river cleanup projects.

For the river's first , it is referred to as the Medellín, and after that it is known as the Porce. It is a tributary of the Nechi River, which flows in turn into the Cauca River.

Every year, the Christmas lighting of Medellín takes place on the Medellín River.

Porce III Dam 
The river is the site of the Porce III Dam, which was completed in 2011.

History 
From 1883 to 1916, the canalization of the river aroused the interest of the upper class, who saw in this work the possibility of improving the hygienic and sanitary conditions of the city, but also concentrated the desire to drain the territory, improve its conditions and incorporate them into the city to expand the urban area between the old village and the banks of the river.

"Tire load sensitivity describes the behaviour of tires under load. Conventional pneumatic tires do not behave as classical friction theory would suggest. The load sensitivity of most real tires in their typical operating range is such that the coefficient of friction decreases as the vertical load, Fz, increases. The maximum lateral force that can be developed does increase as the vertical load increases, but at a diminishing rate.

Behaviour
Coulomb friction theory says that the maximum horizontal force developed should be proportional to the vertical load on the tire. In practice, the maximum horizontal force Fy that can be generated is proportional, roughly, to the vertical load Fz raised to the power of somewhere between 0.7 and 0.9, typically.  

Production car tires typically develop this maximum lateral force, or cornering force, at a slip angle of 6-10 degrees, although this angle increases as the vertical load on the tire increases.  Formula 1 car tires may reach a peak side force at 3 degrees

Example

As an example, here is data extracted from Milliken and Milliken's ""Race Car Vehicle Dynamics"", figure 2.9:

The same sensitivity is typically seen in the longitudinal forces, and combined lateral and longitudinal slip.

"“Hymn to Proserpine” is a poem by Algernon Charles Swinburne, published in Poems and Ballads in 1866.  The poem is addressed to the goddess Proserpina, the Roman equivalent of Persephone, but laments the rise of Christianity for displacing the pagan goddess and her pantheon.

The epigraph at the beginning of the poem is the phrase Vicisti, Galilaee, Latin for ""You have conquered, O Galilean"", the supposed dying words of the Emperor Julian.  He had tried to reverse the official endorsement of Christianity by the Roman Empire.  The poem is cast in the form of a lament by a person professing the paganism of classical antiquity and lamenting its passing, and expresses regret at the rise of Christianity.

The line ""Time and the Gods are at strife"" inspired the title of Lord Dunsany's Time and the Gods.

The poem is quoted by Sue Bridehead in Thomas Hardy's 1895 novel, Jude the Obscure and also by Edward Ashburnham in Ford Madox Ford's The Good Soldier.

"The Hive is a recording studio in North Hollywood, Los Angeles at 5500 Cahuenga Blvd, owned and run by the members of the alternative rock band 311.

Origin 
In 2000, after finishing touring for Soundsystem, the five members of 311 grew distraught with having to pay upwards of $2,000 a day in professional recording studios. Seeking a more independent-style place to work, they found a place in North Hollywood where they could record and pay rent of $3,000 a month. The band soon loaded in two 24 track analog tape machines and Pro Tools technology, fully furnished the place, and began working on their next album.

Recordings done at the Hive 
Prior to 311 purchasing The Hive, it was actively used as a music studio in the 1970s and 1980s. Notable acts such as Missing Persons and Adam Ant have recorded there. Just before 311 started using it, it was used as a voice-over studio for movies.

Since 311 moved into the studio, they have recorded and mixed six albums at The Hive; 2001's From Chaos, 2003's Evolver, 2005's Don't Tread on Me, 2009's Uplifter, 2011's Universal Pulse and 2014's Stereolithic. The band worked with producer Ron Saint Germain on From Chaos, Evolver, and Don't Tread on Me, while Bob Rock produced Uplifter and Universal Pulse, and Scott Ralston produced Stereolithic, making it the first time since 1999's Soundsystem that he produced a 311 album.

Other, lesser-known recording artists have also recorded sessions at The Hive, the most notable being the Volcom Entertainment act Pepper who recorded the minor-hit ""Give It Up"" at The Hive.

The Hive can be seen in more detail on the Enhanced CD features on From Chaos and Evolver.

The APG II system, of 2003, also recognizes such a family, and assigns it to the order Poales in the clade commelinids, in the monocots. The family consists of two genera, totalling only a few species, perennial plants of wet habitats in South America and South Africa.

This represents a slight change from the APG system, 1998, which treated the two genera as each constituting their own family (Prioniaceae and Thurniaceae), both placed in the order Poales.

The Cronquist system of 1981 also recognized such a family and placed it in the order Juncales in the subclass Commelinidae in class Liliopsida in division Magnoliophyta.

The Wettstein system, last updated in 1935, placed the family in order Liliiflorae.

"""Jungle Man"" is a song by the American rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers from their 1985 album, Freaky Styley. It was released as the album's first single, however failed to chart. A music video released around the same time of the album's release on August 16, 1985. The band couldn't get a proper music video released, so manager Lindy Goetz used different clips of live performances of the song from May 1985 to January 1986 edited together with the album version of the song playing on top. 

In his autobiography ""Scar Tissue"", Anthony Kiedis reveals the song is an ode to his friend Flea: ""this half man, half beast born in the belly of the volcano in Australia and using his thumb as a conductor of thunder on the bass"".

Jason Birchmeier of AllMusic considered ""Jungle Man"" to be one of the highlights from the album.

Reception
John Leland at Spin said, ""Take away the Chilis' glaring flaws and they're just another band. Much of this record sounds like a bunch of white guys playing funk. They do it with some élan, and Fred Wesley and the Horny Horns help, but they sacrifice some of their identity for the sake of competence.

The book presents a description of their European tour in the 1920s, when they were fresh out of college from Bryn Mawr. Skinner wrote of Kimbrough, ""To know Emily is to enhance one's days with gaiety, charm and occasional terror"". The book was popular with readers, spending five weeks atop the New York Times Non-Fiction Best Seller list in the winter of 1943.

The book was made into a motion picture in 1944, and in 1946 it was dramatized as a 3-act comedy play by Jean Kerr. In 1950 the book served as the basis for a CBS television comedy series. The series initially had the same name as the book, but after two weeks it was retitled The Girls. In 1960 a 2-act musical comedy version of the book was created.

During the Second World War, Hugh Trevor-Roper discovered that this book was used as a codebook by German intelligence.

"""Driving the Last Spike"" is the third track on the Genesis album We Can't Dance, released in 1991.

The song's lyrics by Phil Collins are about the Navvies: railway workers of the 19th century, many of whom died constructing Britain's railways. The song narrates the thoughts and feelings of an unnamed railway worker in the form of a soliloquy or internal monologue. The title is a phrase meaning the completion of a major railway project—placing the ""last spike"" is often a momentous occasion. The original idea came from a book that actor Dennis Waterman gave to Collins.

Despite not being released as a single, ""Driving the Last Spike"" charted in Canada and the United States, peaking at number 51 on the Canadian RPM Top Singles chart and number 25 on the US Billboard Album Rock Tracks chart.

Live performances
""Driving the Last Spike"" was performed live only on the band's 1992 The Way We Walk Tour. The second half of the song (starting at 5:41) 
was transposed to a lower key starting after the first nine shows of the tour. This was done to accommodate Collins' deepening voice without straining. (A recording of an early performance of ""Driving the Last Spike"" was released as an Atlantic Records promo CD featuring the second half of the song in the album key.)

""Driving the Last Spike"" was featured on the live album The Way We Walk, Volume Two: The Longs, and the live DVD The Way We Walk - Live in Concert.

"America's National Game is a book by Albert Spalding, published in 1911, that details the early history of the sport of baseball. It is one of the defining books in the early formative years of modern baseball.

Much of the story is told first-hand; since the 1850s, Spalding had been involved in the game, first as a pitcher and later a manager and club owner. Later he branched out to become a leading manufacturer of sporting goods.

In addition to his personal recollections, he had access to the records of Henry Chadwick, the game's first statistician and archivist. Much of his early history of the game is considered to be reliable. Spalding was, however, said to aggrandize his role in the major moments in baseball's history. Early editions of the book include quality full-page photo-plates of important players.

"""The Triumph of Time"" is a poem by Algernon Charles Swinburne, published in Poems and Ballads in 1866. It is in adapted ottava rima and is full of elaborate use of literary devices, particularly alliteration. The theme, which purports to be autobiographical, is that of rejected love. The speaker deplores the ruin of his life, and in tones at times reminiscent of Hamlet, craves oblivion, for which the sea serves as a constant metaphor.

The first, ""Fuchsia triphylla"", was discovered on the Caribbean island of Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic) about 1696–1697 by the French Minim monk and botanist, Charles Plumier, during his third expedition to the Greater Antilles.  He named the new genus after the renowned German botanist Leonhart Fuchs (1501–1566). Phygelius, common names Cape fuchsia or Cape figwort, is a genus of flowering plants in the Scrophulariaceae family, native to wet slopes and banks in southern Africa.  They are evergreen shrubs often treated as perennials in colder climates.  They bear many pendent tubular flowers over a long period in summer, in shades of white, yellow and red.  The vague similarity of the blooms to fuchsias has led to the common name Cape fuchsia, though they are not closely related.

"Call of the Mastodon is a compilation album of early recordings from the American metal band Mastodon. It was released on February 7, 2006, by Relapse Records.

History
The songs on Call of the Mastodon originally appeared on Mastodon's first release, 9 Song Demo, with lead vocals by Eric Saner. After Saner left the band, the vocals were re-recorded by guitarist Brent Hinds and bassist Troy Sanders, and the updated songs appeared on the band's Slick Leg and Lifesblood EPs. Several years later, the songs (with Hinds' and Sanders' vocals) were remixed and remastered by original engineer Matt Washburn, and released as Call of the Mastodon.

In a documentary on the making of Crack the Skye, Hinds referred to Call of the Mastodon as the band's first studio album; this sentiment was later echoed by guitarist Bill Kelliher when he appeared on Loudwire's 'Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction'.

"New Country (; Nor Yerkir) was a political party in Armenia. It was created by Artashes Tumanyan, Chief of staff to former President Robert Kocharyan.

History
Artashes Tumanyan participated in the 2003 Armenian parliamentary election under the Armenian Revolutionary Federation's (ARF) proportional list. Tumanyan later established the New Country party and there was speculation that New Country could form a political alliance with the ARF. However, Robert Kocharyan was opposed to any cooperation between the two parties. 

The party had intentions to participate in future elections and had scheduled its founding congress for 18 March 2006. However, on 16 March 2006, Tumanyan announced that he no longer would be an active member of the newly established party. As such, the party dissolved and had not participated in any elections. 

Despite the set back, Robert Poladyan, a member of New Country was tasked with continuing the objectives of the party as an organization under the same name, instead of a political party.

Ideology
In February 2006, the party published a lengthy manifesto in three of Armenia's major newspapers. The party pledged to strive for the country's democratization and economic liberalization. The party had also set the ambitious goal of attaining Armenia's membership and accession to the European Union by 2015.

Tumanyan had stated that the ""European Union is a unique institution, which promotes the identity and diversity of nations,"" while promoting Armenia's European integration during a press interview.

The party also supported the strengthening of democracy, freedoms and rights of every citizen, and a free media.

"Alexander II (Greek: Άλέξανδρος) was a king of Epirus, and the son of Pyrrhus and Lanassa, the daughter of the Sicilian tyrant Agathocles.

Reign
He succeeded his father as king in 272 BC, and continued the war which his father had begun with Antigonus II Gonatas, whom he succeeded in driving from the kingdom of Macedon.  He was, however, dispossessed of both Macedon and Epirus by Demetrius II of Macedon, the son of Antigonus II; upon which he took refuge amongst the Acarnanians. By their assistance and that of his own subjects, who entertained a great attachment for him, he recovered Epirus. It appears that he was in alliance with the Aetolians. 

Alexander married his paternal half-sister Olympias, by whom he had two sons, Pyrrhus ΙΙ, Ptolemy ΙΙ and a daughter, Phthia. Beloch places the death of King Alexander II ""about 255"", and supports this date with an elaborate chain of reasoning. On the death of Alexander, Olympias assumed the regency on behalf of her sons, and married Phthia to Demetrius.  There are extant silver and copper coins of this king.  The former bear a youthful head covered with the skin of an elephant's head.  The reverse represents Pallas holding a spear in one hand and a shield in the other, and before her stands an eagle on a thunderbolt.

Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe stated ""It's a more cerebral and conventional documentary"", dull and ""poorly balanced scale"". Andrea Gronvall of Chicago Reader said ""sketchy evidence"" and ""transforming gossip into entertainment"".

Controversy
Most mainstream historians and surviving eyewitnesses dispute Machtan's argument (see Sexuality of Adolf Hitler).

"Cakaudrove West Open is a former electoral division of Fiji, one of 25 open constituencies that were elected by universal suffrage (the remaining 46 seats, called communal constituencies, were allocated by ethnicity).  Established by the 1997 Constitution, it came into being in 1999 and was used for the parliamentary elections of 1999, 2001, and 2006. It was located in the southeastern part of the northern island of Vanua Levu.

The 2013 Constitution promulgated by the Military-backed interim government abolished all constituencies and established a form of proportional representation, with the entire country voting as a single electorate.

Election results 
In the following tables, the primary vote refers to first-preference votes cast.  The final vote refers to the final tally after votes for low-polling candidates have been progressively redistributed to other candidates according to pre-arranged electoral agreements (see electoral fusion), which may be customized by the voters (see instant run-off voting).

In the 1999 election, Sitiveni Rabuka won with more than 50 percent of the primary vote; therefore, there was no redistribution of preferences.

"Gigantiform cementoma is a rare, autosomal dental tumor.  It is benign, but without intervention it can result in severe disfigurement of the jaw.  The cause of this tumor is currently unknown. This is an exceedingly rare tumor with only a handful of documented cases worldwide. The most famous case is of Novemthree Siahaan (who died on September 15, 2005), a young Indonesian boy from Batam Island who received medical care in Haulien, Taiwan through a Buddhist missionary from the Tzu Chi Foundation, which was documented on the Discovery Health Channel. Another famous case is a young Korean girl named Ayun Lee (August 26, 2003~) and her father Young-hak Lee whose case has shown that the tumor can be heritable. She is currently under treatment, which she may need to continue until her growth stops in her early 20s. 

The term has been used in the past to describe florid cemento-osseous dysplasia, but it is now reserved for an autosomal dominant condition affecting the maxillae. It affects mostly Caucasian people under the age of 10. Treatment is difficult. Surgical removal of the affected bone is needed, and has to be followed by reconstruction.

"Dynasty is an American prime time television soap opera that aired on ABC from January 12, 1981, to May 11, 1989. The series, created by Richard and Esther Shapiro and produced by Aaron Spelling, revolves around the Carringtons, a wealthy family residing in Denver, Colorado. Dynasty stars John Forsythe as oil magnate Blake Carrington, Linda Evans as his new wife Krystle, and later Joan Collins as his former wife Alexis.

Dynasty was conceived as ABC's competitor to CBS's prime time series Dallas. Ratings for the show's first season were unimpressive, but a revamp for the second season that included the arrival of Collins as scheming Alexis saw ratings enter the top 20. By the fall of 1982, it was a top 10 show, and by the spring of 1985, it was the #1 show in the United States. The series declined considerably in popularity during its final two seasons, and it was ultimately cancelled in the spring of 1989 after nine seasons and 220 episodes. A two-part miniseries, Dynasty: The Reunion, aired in October 1991.

Season one of Dynasty was delayed by the 1980 Screen Actors Guild strike, season two by the 1981 Writers Guild of America strike, and season nine by the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike.

NOTE: The Production Codes were taken from the United States Copyright Office.

A resident of Stanley Bridge, Carew was elected by acclamation as leader of the Prince Edward Island Liberal Party, then the Official Opposition in the Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island, in 1999 following the resignation of Keith Milligan.

Carew ran for a seat in the legislature in the 2000 general election but was not successful, giving him the distinction of being the only leader of the Liberal Party to not win a seat.

Carew resigned from leadership of the party following the 2000 election and was replaced by Ron MacKinley on an interim basis.

"Ayre ( ; ) is one of the six sheadings of the Isle of Man.

It is located in the north of the island (part of the traditional North Side division) and consists of the three historic parishes of Andreas, Bride and (Kirk Christ) Lezayre.

The town of Ramsey, which is administered separately, covers areas of two historic parishes (Lezayre, and Maughold in the sheading of Garff). It is treated as part of Garff for some purposes, e.g. the coroner.

Other settlements in the sheading include Glen Auldyn and Sulby (both in the parish of Lezayre).

Etymology
The derivation of the word ayre is from Old Norse ""eyrr"", meaning a shingle beach. It refers to a storm beach forming a narrow spit of shingle or sand cutting across the landward and seaward ends of a shallow bay. This may partly cut off a sheltered stretch of water from the sea to form a shallow freshwater loch. This word is still in use for the particular landform in the Northern Isles of Scotland.

MHKs and elections
Before the 2016 elections, Ayre was one of the House of Keys constituencies. It is now part of the Ayre & Michael constituency.

"Lewisia is a plant genus, named for Meriwether Lewis who encountered the species in 1806.  The native habitat of ""Lewisia"" species is north facing cliffs in the western part of North America.  Local Native Americans ate the roots, which have also been used to treat sore throats. Lysichiton is a genus in the family Araceae.  These plants are known commonly as skunk cabbage or less often as swamp lantern.  The spelling Lysichitum is also found.  The genus has two species, one found in north-east Asia (Japan and Russian Far East), the other in north-west America (Aleutians to Santa Cruz County in California). Lysichiton americanus, also called western skunk cabbage (USA), yellow skunk cabbage (UK), American skunk-cabbage (Britain and Ireland) or swamp lantern, is a plant found in swamps and wet woods, along streams and in other wet areas of the Pacific Northwest, where it is one of the few native species in the arum family.  The plant is called skunk cabbage because of the distinctive ""skunky"" odor that it emits when it blooms.  This odor will permeate the area where the plant grows, and can be detected even in old, dried specimens.  The distinctive odor attracts its pollinators, scavenging flies and beetles. Although similarly named and with a similar smell, the plant is easy to distinguish from the eastern skunk cabbage (""Symplocarpus foetidus""), another species in the arum family found in eastern North America.",Answer the following question based on the context: Can Lysichiton and Lewisia both be found in America?,

The Statutes of Canada are organized by alphabetical order and are updated and amended by the Government of Canada from time to time.

Publication of statutes
At the time that the Interpretation Act (1867) was passed, the Statutes of Canada were required to be distributed and published at the end of each session of parliament.

"Gunboat Vale was a Vale-class Rendel gunboat built for the Royal Norwegian Navy at Karljohansvern Naval Yard in 1874. She was one of a class of five gunboats - the other ships in the class was Brage, Nor, Uller and Vidar.

Vale was, in addition to the heavy, muzzle-loading main gun, armed with a small 'Quick Fire' gun and a 37mm Hotchkiss Revolving Cannon (broadly similar to the Gatling gun).

Later Vale and her sister ships was rebuilt as mine layers, and she served in this role when the Germans invaded in 1940. During the Norwegian Campaign she served mainly in the Sognefjord. She was captured by German forces after the surrender of Norwegian forces in southern Norway, and returned to Norway after the war.

The vessel was built at the Naval Yard at Horten, and had yard number 54.

"Aerangis gracillima is a species of plant in the Orchidaceae family.  It is found in Cameroon and Gabon.  Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical dry forests. Gillenia trifoliata (common names Bowman's root and Indian physic) is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family, native to eastern North America from Ontario to Georgia.  It is an erect herbaceous perennial growing to 100 cm tall by 60 cm wide, with 3-palmate leaves and pale pink flowers with narrow petals and reddish calyces above red coloured stems in spring and summer. Gillenia (syn.  ""Porteranthus"") is a genus of two species of perennial herbs in the Rosaceae family.  Common names for plants in this genus include: Bowman's root, Indian-physic, American ipecac.  This genus is endemic to dry open woods with acidic soils in eastern North America.  Both plants are subshrubs with exposed semi-woody branches and serrated leaves; the larger lower leaves are divided into palmately arranged leaflets.  Plants bloom in May, June, or July; blooms are composed of five slender white petals which are loosely arranged and typically appear slightly twisted and limp as if they were wilted.  The flowers mature into small capsules.  These plants are often planted as ornamentals and used in herbal medicine. Aerangis, abbreviated as Aergs in horticultural trade, is a genus of the Orchid family (Orchidaceae).  The name of this genus has been derived from the Greek words 'aer' (air) and 'angos' (urn), referring to the form of the lip.  It is the type genus of the subtribe Aerangidinae.  Approximately 50 species in this genus are known mostly from tropical Africa, but also from the Comoro Islands, Madagascar and Sri Lanka.","Answer the following question based on the context: What plant has more species, Aerangis or Gillenia?",

"Elfriede Martha Blauensteiner (22 January 1931 – 18 November 2003), dubbed The Black Widow, was an Austrian serial killer who murdered at least three victims by poison. In each case, she inherited the victim's possessions.

Crimes 

On 7 March 1997, Blauensteiner was found guilty of murdering 77-year-old Alois Pichler and sentenced to life imprisonment. Her former lawyer Harald Schmidt was jailed for seven years for being an accomplice to grievous bodily harm and for forging the will of Alois Pichler. She was a gambling addict, and it is believed that she would deliberately date rich elderly men and poison them before gambling away the money which had been left to her in their fabricated wills. Four years later, she was found guilty of murdering her 64-year-old husband Friedrick Doecker and 84-year-old female neighbour Franziska Koeberl. Although she was only convicted of a total of three murders, Austrian police believe that she may have murdered at least 10 people. Keoberl is believed to have been her only female victim.

After serving less than seven years of her life sentence, Blauensteiner died from a brain tumour on 18 November 2003, in a Vienna hospital. She was cremated at Feuerhalle Simmering, where also her ashes were buried.

"Amarasimha (IAST: , ) was a Sanskrit grammarian and poet from ancient India, of whose personal history hardly anything is known. He is said to have been ""one of the nine gems that adorned the throne of Vikramaditya,"" and according to the evidence of Xuanzang, this is the Chandragupta Vikramaditya (Chandragupta II) who flourished about CE 375. Other sources describe him as belonging to the period of Vikramaditya of 7th century. Most of Amarasiṃha's works were lost, with the exception of the celebrated Amara-Kosha (IAST: ) (Treasury of Amara). The first reliable mention of the Amarakosha is in the Amoghavritti of Shakatayana composed during the reign of Amoghavarsha (814-867 CE)

The Amarakosha is a lexicon of Sanskrit words in three books, and hence is sometimes called the Trikāṇḍī or the ""Tripartite"". It is also known as ""Namalinganushasana"". The Amarakosha contains 10,000 words, and is arranged, like other works of its class, in metre, to aid the memory.

The first chapter of the Kosha was printed at Rome in Tamil character in 1798. An edition of the entire work, with English notes and an index by Henry Thomas Colebrooke appeared at Serampore in 1808. The Sanskrit text was printed at Calcutta in 1831. A French translation by ALA Loiseleur-Deslongchamps was published at Paris in 1839. B. L.

"The Cashibo or Carapache are an indigenous people of Peru. They live near the Aguaytía, San Alejandro, and Súngaro Rivers. The Cashibo have three subgroups, that are the Cashiñon, Kakataibo, and Ruño peoples. They mainly live in five villages.

Language
Cashibo people speak the Cashibo-Cacataibo language, a Western Panoan language which is written in the Latin script and taught in primary schools.

History
When first approached by missionaries in 1757, the Cashibo killed one of them and forced the rest to flee. They maintained hostile relations with neighboring tribes. They joined Juan Santos Atahualpa in 1744 in the destruction of missions. In 1870, Shetebo and Conibo people raided the Cashibo.

Until the 20th century, Cashibo avoided outside contact. In 1930, they numbered 4,000 but their population was reduced by diseases. Simón Bolívar Odicio dominated the Cashibo from 1930 to 1940. Odicio was a Cashibo who had been kidnapped and raised by the Shipibo. He encouraged the tribe to open a road into their territory, which brought on non-native settlement and rapid acculturation, with devastating effects on the tribe.

"Camden is an electoral district of the Legislative Assembly in the Australian state of New South Wales in Sydney's south-west. It is currently represented by Sally Quinnell of the  party, who achieved a 13% swing in the 2023 election.

It currently includes the suburbs of Austral, Badgerys Creek, Bickley Vale, Bringelly, Camden, Camden Park, Camden South, Catherine Field, Cawdor, Cobbitty, Currans Hill, Elderslie, Ellis Lane, Gledswood Hills, Grasmere, Greendale, Gregory Hills, Harrington Park, Kirkham, Leppington, Luddenham, Mount Annan, Narellan, Narellan Vale, Oran Park, Rossmore, Smeaton Grange, Spring Farm, Wallacia and West Hoxton.

History
Camden was originally created in 1859, replacing part of West Camden and named after the town of Camden or Camden County, which includes Camden, the Southern Highlands and the Illawarra.  It elected two members from 1859 to 1889 and three members from 1889 to 1894, when multi-member electorates were abolished.  It was abolished in 1920, with the introduction of proportional representation and absorbed into Cumberland.  It was recreated in 1981. In recent decades it has been a marginal seat, falling to both the  and  parties on separate occasions.
Except in 1984-91 and 1995-2003, Camden in its second incarnation, has been held by the government party.

Camden was evident as a bellwether seat at the 1991 election when the ALP lost the seat to the Liberal Party despite the former party making huge gains at that election which was close but not enough for them to win the election. If the ALP had retained Camden in 1991, the party would have been in a strong position to form a minority government when it then won The Entrance by-election in 1992.

"In political jargon, a self-licking ice cream cone is a self-perpetuating system that has no purpose other than to sustain itself. The phrase appeared to have been first used in 1991–1992, in a book about Gulf War weapons systems by Norman Friedman, and On Self-Licking Ice Cream Cones, a paper by Pete Worden about NASA's bureaucracy, to describe the relationship between the Space Shuttle and Space Station.

Since then, the term has been used to describe the purported habit of government-funded organisations and programs spending taxpayer money to lobby for more funding from the taxpayer. Other things compared have included financial bubbles, chatshows and reality television. In The Irish Times, Kevin Courtney observed that ""many organisations are also stuck in limbo, destined to keep lurching on without ever achieving their stated goal. That’s because their real goal is simply to carry on regardless."" The Cold War infrastructure has also been compared to a self-licking ice cream cone, given that expensive projects continued to be financed long after world communism had ceased to pose a viable threat.

Richard Hoggart used the term to describe certain United Nations programmes.

Franklin C. Spinney used the term to refer to the military–industrial complex.

In sport, the Bowl Alliance was criticised using the term.

The Op. 135 quartet is the shortest of Beethoven's late quartets. Under the introductory slow chords in the last movement, which is headed ""Der schwer gefaßte Entschluß"" (The Difficult Decision), Beethoven wrote in the manuscript ""Muß es sein?"" (Must it be?) to which he responds, with the faster main theme of the movement, ""Es muß sein!"" (It must be!). 

It is in four movements:

 Allegretto (F major)
 Vivace (F major)
 Lento assai, cantante e tranquillo (D major)
 ""Der schwer gefaßte Entschluß"". Grave, ma non troppo tratto (""Muss es sein?"") – Allegro (""Es muss sein!"") – Grave, ma non troppo tratto – Allegro (F minor – F major)

The autograph manuscript of the work is preserved in the Beethoven House.

The performance of the work takes around 22–25 minutes.

The work features in Czech author Milan Kundera's The Unbearable Lightness of Being, where the character Tomas uses the phrases ""Muß es sein?"" and ""Es muß sein!"" to describe his approach to fate.

"The Symphony on a French Mountain Air (), Op. 25, is written in 1886 by Vincent d'Indy.

As indicated by the title, d'Indy took the principal theme from a folk song he heard at Périer overlooking the Cévennes mountains (hence the work's alternative name, Symphonie cévenole).  Originally conceived as a fantaisie for piano and orchestra, the symphony is unusual in that it is scored for a prominent (but never dominant) piano part together with orchestra, and has acquired the label sinfonia concertante from some critics.

It consists of three movements and lasts just under half an hour:
Assez lent - Modérément animé
Assez modéré, mais sans lenteur
Animé
The symphony begins with an evocative melody played first by a cor anglais.  The main themes of subsequent movements are based on this melody, and as the symphony progresses each subsequent variation becomes more and more like the original version.

The work was dedicated to Marie-Léontine Bordes-Pène, who was the soloist at the premiere in Paris on March 20, 1887.

Prior to starting his military service, he also trained in the United States with Pierre Brunet.  Giletti expected to defend his World title in 1961, but those championships were cancelled after the crash of Sabena Flight 548 killed all members of the U.S. team.

"One Last Dance is a 2003 American-Canadian romantic drama film about three dancers in New York City. The film was directed and written by Lisa Niemi, wife of actor Patrick Swayze. One Last Dance starred both Swayze and Niemi, who also jointly produced, alongside George de la Peña in a major role. It was filmed in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.

One Last Dance was choreographed by Patsy Swayze, Niemi's mother-in-law and the mother of Patrick Swayze. Niemi, who also wrote the script in addition to directing the film, drew its content from the real-life experiences and struggles of performing artists.

Plot
The story revolves around three dancers who are forced to reconcile their differences and pasts. Travis (Swayze), Chrissa (Niemi), and Max (De La Pena) were three students of master choreographer Alex McGrath, but they had a falling out many years ago over a particularly difficult piece that Alex had choreographed specifically for them. Unexpectedly, McGrath dies. This reunites the three, who agree to attempt the dance piece once more to save his company. In the process, however, they all reopen old emotional wounds that had never properly healed. Travis and Chrissa have a daughter together, Bree. Bree wishes to follow in her mother's footsteps of dancing and even takes any opportunity to steal her mother's Pointe shoes and dance around the house in them, much to her mother's chagrin. It is realized that Max should be the new head of the company. Travis, Chrissa and Max each want to quit for good at some point. But finally all grudgingly follow through and come full-circle as dancers.

"Zhang Shijie () was a  Chinese admiral, military general, and politician during the Mongol invasion of China.

Zhang was born to a prosperous family in present-day Hebei (part of the Liao empire, then Jin empire). After the fall of the Jin to the Mongol Empire, Zhang joined the Mongol army and was stationed in present-day Henan province under the command of Zhang Rou, a Han Chinese general of the Mongol Empire.

Zhang Shijie defected from the Mongols to the Southern Song dynasty after he committed a crime, to evade punishment. Zhang Shijie gained his position in the Song administration after passing his civil service examination, eventually becoming a successful administrator overseeing civil, military, and naval duties for the Southern Song.

After the fall of the capital Lin'an (modern-day Hangzhou), Zhang commanded the Song naval forces during the Mongol invasion of China in 1276, and served as the last commander of the Song fleet, during the attempt to escort Emperor Bing of Song and other Imperial officials as they fled the Mongols in 1279. However, Zhang's fleet was intercepted by Mongol forces under the command of Zhang Hongfan (the son of Zhang Shijie's former commander Zhang Rou) off the coast of Xinhui and destroyed at the Battle of Yamen on 19 March 1279. Prime Minister Lu Xiufu committed suicide, drowning the child Emperor with him, following their defeat. Although Zhang Shijie was able to escape with his remaining ships, he was said to have died a few days later during a storm at sea. Along with Lu Xiufu and Wen Tianxiang, Zhang is considered one of the ""Three Loyal Princes of the Song"".

"Brierley Hill & Withymoor F.C. was a football club based in Halesowen, West Midlands, England. They were established in 1955, originally as Oldswinford F.C., and went through several subsequent name changes, but folded in 2008.

History
The club was founded in 1955 under the name Oldswinford F.C., and it was under this name that they first joined the West Midlands (Regional) League in 1975.  In 1993 they changed their name to Brierley Hill Town, and under this name they were founder members of the Midland Football Alliance in 1994.  Their first season in that league saw them finish bottom, having won just three times all season, and they returned to the West Midlands League.

In 2001, financial difficulties led to them merging with West Hagley F.C. of the Midland Football Combination to form Brierley & Hagley F.C., initially ground-sharing with Halesowen Harriers. After that club's demise they shared The Sports Ground with Lye Town, and later used Halesowen Town's The Grove as their home venue.  The club hoped to develop their Wassell Grove land into a new stadium, but these plans came to nothing as the club was wound up in 2008 after the resignation of the club's main funder, chairman Stephen Lea.

Club records
Best league position: 20th in Midland Football Alliance, 1994–95
Best FA Cup performance: 1st qualifying round, 1984–85 and 1985–86 (as Oldswinford F.C.), 2007–08
Best FA Vase performance: 1st round on several occasions, most recently in 2001–02

"Genipa, the genip-trees, are a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae.  This genus is closely allied to ""Gardenia""; several ""Gardenia"" species were originally placed in ""Genipa"".  It is not to be confused with genip (""Melicoccus bijugatus""), a completely unrelated eudicot.  The name is derived from ""genipapo"", the Guianan name for ""G. americana"" (commonly known as huito).  The genus is also commonly called jagua, xagua or xaqua. Casasia is a genus of flowering plants in the Rubiaceae family.  These shrubs or small trees occur on the Caribbean islands and in one case (Seven-year Apple, ""C. clusiifolia"") in Florida.  Some of the ten accepted species were formerly placed elsewhere, e.g. in the related genip-tree genus (""Genipa""), in ""Gardenia"" or in ""Randia"". Gardenia tubifera, also called golden gardenia, is a species of flowering small tree in the genus ""Gardenia"", native to Asia.  It is a small tree, growing to a height of 2–4 m (6–12 ft) high with a spread of 1–2 m (3–6 ft).  It prefers tropical conditions and will not tolerate temperatures below freezing. Gardenia is a genus of flowering plants in the coffee family, Rubiaceae, native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, Madagascar and Pacific Islands. Gardenia is a genus of about 250 species of flowering plants Hymenolobium is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae.  It belongs to the subfamily Faboideae.  It was formerly assigned to the tribe Dalbergieae, but recent molecular phylogenetic evidence has placed it in a unique clade named the ""Andira"" clade. Andira is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae.  It is distributed in the tropical Americas, except for ""A. inermis"", which also occurs in Africa.

A single cup within a regular muffin tin is  and most often has room for 12 muffins, although tins holding 6, 8, 11, 24, and 35 muffins do exist. A single cup within a mini muffin tin is , and because these are less common, there are several standard numbers of cups per tin, including 6, 12, and 24 cups per tin. A single cup within a jumbo muffin tin is , and again because these are uncommon, there are several standard numbers of cups per tin, including 4, 6, and 12 cups per tin.

Muffin tins can be made out of aluminum, stainless steel, cast iron, or silicone. In addition, aluminum and stainless steel muffin tins may be coated with Teflon or other non-stick coatings. Historically, galvanized steel has been used for muffin tins but this is no longer common.

"Thujopsis (pronounced ) is a conifer in the cypress family (Cupressaceae), the sole member of the genus being Thujopsis dolabrata.  It is endemic to Japan, where it is named asunaro (あすなろ).  It is similar to the closely related genus ""Thuja"" (Arborvitae), differing in the broader, thicker leaves and thick cones.  It is also called hiba, false arborvitae, or hiba arborvitae. Argyreia is a genus of plants in the Convolvulaceae family. A loline alkaloid is a member of the 1-aminopyrrolizidines (often referred to as lolines), which are bioactive natural products with several distinct biological and chemical features.  The lolines are insecticidal and insect-deterrent compounds that are produced in grasses infected by endophytic fungal symbionts of the genus ""Epichloë"" (anamorphic species: ""Neotyphodium"").  Lolines increase resistance of endophyte-infected grasses to insect herbivores, and may also protect the infected plants from environmental stresses such as drought and spatial competition.  They are alkaloids, organic compounds containing basic nitrogen atoms.  The basic chemical structure of the lolines comprises a saturated pyrrolizidine ring, a primary amine at the C-1 carbon, and an internal ether bridge—a hallmark feature of the lolines, which is uncommon in organic compounds—joining two distant ring (C-2 and C-7) carbons (see Fig. 1).  Different substituents at the C-1 amine, such as methyl, formyl, and acetyl groups, yield loline species that have variable bioactivity against insects.  Besides endophyte–grass symbiota, loline alkaloids have also been identified in some other plant species; namely, ""Adenocarpus"" species (family Fabaceae) and ""Argyreia mollis"" (family Convolvulaceae).",Answer the following question based on the context: Are both Argyreia and Thujopsis genus of plants ?,

"The bare-throated tiger heron (Tigrisoma mexicanum) is a wading bird of the heron family, Ardeidae, found from Mexico to northwestern Colombia, with one recorded sighting from the United States in Hidalgo County, Texas. It is  in length and weighs .

This large species is found in more open habitats than other Tigrisoma herons, such as river and lake banks. It waits often motionless for suitable prey such as fish, frogs or crabs to come within reach of its long bill.

This is a solitary breeder, not normally found in heron colonies. The nest is a small flattish stick platform in a tree into which 2–3 green-tinged white eggs are laid.

Description
The throat is bare and is greenish-yellow to orange in all plumages. The adult has black crown and light grey sides of the head, the sides of the neck and the upperparts otherwise blackish narrowly barred buff. The median stripe down the fore-neck is white-bordered with black; the remaining underparts are dull cinnamon brown. The juvenile is buff coarsely barred with black, more mottled and vermiculated on wings; the throat, median underparts, and belly are whitish.

The flight is heavy, and the call is a hoarse howk-howk-howk. Males also give a booming hrrrowwr! call, especially at sunset. During emission of the call, the beak opens wide and undulations can be seen along the course of the throat from mid-thorax caudally.

"Dauphin Lake is located in western Manitoba near the city of Dauphin, Manitoba. The lake covers an area of  and has a drainage basin of about . The Mossy River drains the lake into Lake Winnipegosis. The basin is drained by seven major streams and has a total relief of .

The lake is located within the territory of three rural municipalities; in descending order of area they are the RM of Ochre River, the RM of Dauphin, and the RM of Mossey River.

Dauphin Lake was named after the Dauphin of France, heir to the French throne, by Francois de La Verendrye in 1739.

Hydrography 

Dauphin Lake is located west of Lake Manitoba and south of Lake Winnipegosis. It receives most of its waters from the west.

Mossy River Dam 
Several efforts have been made to control lake levels in the last century. In 1964, the Mossy River Dam was constructed at Terin's Landing at the outlet of the lake. The ten bay concrete stoplog structure complete with a fish ladder is operated by the Province of Manitoba. The summer target since 1993 has been 854.8 feet (260.54 m). The dam can restrict the outflow when conditions are dry and levels low but the river limits the outflow when the lake is high.

Regulation of the lake is difficult. Conditions can change very quickly. For example, a four-day rain in June 1947 produced an estimated peak inflow of . At normal levels, the Mossy River can only take out about .

Tributaries 
 
Tributaries of Dauphin Lake include the Turtle River, Kerosene Creek, Ochre River, Edwards Creek Drain, Vermillion River, Wilson River, Valley River, Mowat Creek and the Mink River.

"The A-91 is a bullpup assault rifle developed during the 1990s by KBP Instrument Design Bureau in Tula, Soviet Union as an offspring of the 9A-91 firearm family.

Design
The A-91 retains the simple gas-operated, rotating bolt action and a trigger unit design from the 9A-91, it features a bullpup polymer housing, with an integral 40 mm single-shot grenade launcher mounted under the barrel. The earliest prototypes of the A-91 bullpup were added with the grenade launcher above the barrel, and with a frontal vertical foregrip; current models are fitted with the underbarrel launcher, which serves as a forearm. The A-91 has a forward ejection system, initially developed in Tula by designers like Afanasiev during the early 1960s. In this system, the ejection port is located right above the pistol grip, and is directed forward. Extracted cases go from bolt head through the short ejection tube to the ejection port, and fall out of the gun well clear of the shooter's face, even when firing from the left shoulder. As for now, the A-91 is made in small numbers and, probably, is used by some elite police units in Russia; it is also offered for export and domestic military and police sales.

ADS amphibious rifle
In early XXI century designers at KBP designed a dual medium rifle called ADS. The rifle is heavily based on the A-91, but can use 5.45×39mm PSP underwater cartridge. The rifle is in service with Russian combat divers.

""adhaerens"", is often included with it under the name ""deltoidea"" instead of separately, making it difficult to keep count of how many endangered plants there are.

"Cyananthus is a genus that consists of about 30 species of annual or mostly perennial herbs from high mountains of Central and East Asia.  They are little Himalayan plants not higher than 4in.  The name comes from the ""Greek"" for blue flowers.  Leaves are usually small and simple, sometimes narrowing to base, tooth-lobed at summit.  In August to September, the plants bear showy of bright purplish-blue, yellow or white, funnel to bell-shaped, 5-lobed flowers 1in in diameter with stamens free from the corolla and hairy throat.  The flowers are borne singly on stalks.  They always lose the aerial parts during the coldest months, and as spring begins, stems and leaves quickly start to reproduce. Phlebodium is a small genus of two to four species of ferns, native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.  The genus is closely related to ""Polypodium"", and the species were formerly included in that genus. Polypodium is a genus of 75–100 species of true ferns, widely distributed throughout the world, with the highest species diversity in the tropics.  The name is derived from Ancient Greek ""poly"" (πολύ) ""many"" + ""podion"" (πόδιον) ""little foot"", on account of the foot-like appearance of the rhizome and its branches.  They are commonly called polypody or rockcap fern, but for many species unique vernacular names exist.","Answer the following question based on the context: Which genus has more species, Cyananthus or Polypodium?",
"Andrea Andreani (1540–1623) was an Italian engraver on wood, who was among the first printmakers in Italy to use chiaroscuro, which required multiple colours.
 
Andreani was born and generally active in Mantua about 1540 (Brulliot says 1560) and died at Rome in 1623. His engravings are scarce and valuable, and are chiefly copies of Mantegna, Albrecht Dürer, Parmigianino and Titian. The most remarkable of his works are Mercury and Ignorance, the Deluge, Pharaoh's Host Drowned in the Red Sea (after Titian), the Triumph of Caesar (after Mantegna), and Christ retiring from the judgment-seat of Pilate after a relief by Giambologna. He was active 1584–1610 in Florence.

Andreani's work is held in several museums worldwide, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, the Ackland Art Museum, the Clark Art Institute, the Harvard Art Museums, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Albright–Knox Art Gallery, the National Gallery of Canada, the Davis Museum at Wellesley College, the Cooper Hewitt, the University of Michigan Museum of Art, the Bowdoin College Museum of Art, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Princeton University Art Museum, and the British Museum.

"The Electoral district of Wakehurst is an electoral district of the Legislative Assembly in the Australian state of New South Wales. It covers a significant part of Sydney's Northern Beaches as well as parts of the Forest District. Created in 1962, it has been won by the Liberal Party at all but three elections over the last half-century.

History
The seat of Wakehurst was created in the August 1961 electoral redistribution, with its territory drawn partly from the seats of Manly and Collaroy. First contested at the 1962 state election, Wakehurst was named in honour of the popular long-serving Governor of New South Wales from 1937 to 1946, Lord Wakehurst. It was held by the Liberal Party from its creation until the 1978 election, when it was won by the Labor Party as part of the first Wranslide. Although the seat is historically Liberal, Labor held the seat until the 1984 election, when the Liberals retook the seat.

The seat was first won in 1962 by Dick Healey of the Liberal Party. He moved to the new seat of Davidson in 1971. He served as a minister in the Coalition state government from 1973 to 1976, and retired in 1981. Wakehurst was won in 1971 by Allan Viney. He held the seat until his defeat in 1978 by the ALP's Tom Webster. Webster was re-elected at the 1981 election but was defeated in 1984 by Liberal candidate John Booth. Booth held the seat until 1991, when he lost preselection to Brad Hazzard. Hazzard joined the Coalition shadow frontbench after the 1995 election, and served as a minister in the O'Farrell, Baird, Berejiklian and Perrottet governments.

Hazzard retired at the 2023 NSW election, when the Mayor of Northern Beaches Council, Michael Regan, won the seat as an independent candidate.

"Mickey's Racing Adventure is a racing video game developed by Rare and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy Color in 1999. It was followed by Mickey's Speedway USA in 2001.

Gameplay
Mickey's Racing Adventure is a single-player racing game with adventure elements. It is played from an isometric perspective and races consist of land or water tracks.

Development and release
Mickey's Racing Adventure was developed by Rare over the course of approximately six months. It is the company's second Game Boy Color game and its extra mini-games are based on classics such as Loco-Motion. It supports the Game Boy Color's infrared port to transmit data between machines. The game was released in November 1999.

Reception

Mickey's Racing Adventure received positive reviews from critics. IGN reviewer Craig Harris felt that it was Rare's ""first real quality Game Boy Color-exclusive title"" after their ""atrocious"" Conker's Pocket Tales, while GameSpot praised the number of tracks and characters to choose from, stating that Mickey's Racing Adventure ""shows how Game Boy racers should be done"". N64 Magazine said that the game successfully combines the exploration aspects of Rare's Diddy Kong Racing with the racing style of R.C. Pro-Am for the Nintendo Entertainment System, but criticised the lack of a multiplayer mode. Game Informer gave the game an overall score of 8 out of 10 noting the game being well designed, especially for a Disney game, and commenting that the game has plenty of racing courses, characters, power ups and vehicle upgrades concluding ""Mickey's Racing Adventure won't take you an exorbitant amount of time to finish, but you’ll like it all the way to the end"".

"Aimoin of Fleury (; ), French chronicler, was born at Villefranche-de-Longchat, Southwestern France about 960. Early in his life he entered the monastery of Fleury, where he became a monk and then passed the greater part of his life. Between c. 980 and 985 Aimoin wrote about St. Benedict in Abbey of Fleury-sur-Loire.  His chief work is a Historia Francorum, or Libri V. de Gestis Francorum, which deals with the history of the Franks from the earliest times to 653, and was continued by other writers until the middle of the twelfth century. It was much in vogue during the Middle Ages, but its historical value is now regarded as slight. It was edited by G. Waitz and published in the Monumenta Germaniae Historica: Scriptores, Band xxvi (Hanover and Berlin, 1826–1892).

In 1004 he also wrote Vita Abbonis, abbatis Floriacensis, the last of a series of lives of the abbots of Fleury, all of which, except the life of Abbo, have been lost.  This was published by J. Mabillon in the Acta sanctorum ordinis sancti Benedicti (Paris, 1668–1701).

Aimoin's third work was the composition of books ii and iii of the Miracula sancti Benedicti, the first book of which was written by another monk of Fleury named Adrevald ( - 878). This also appears in the Acta sanctorum.

"Tenants Purchase Scheme (TPS) is a scheme which allows tenants in public housing estates under the Hong Kong Housing Authority to purchase their flats. The price is set to be much lower than the market prices of private flats and Home Ownership Scheme (HOS) owing to the age of flats and restriction on selling.

History

The Scheme was announced in 1997 and formally launched a year later. It provided an opportunity for at least 250,000 public housing tenants to acquire their flats at affordable prices over a ten-year period with the ultimate aim of achieving 70% home ownership by 2007.  

In November 2002, in response to a weak property market which was allegedly being distorted by public housing sales schemes, it was decided to terminate the TPS after the sale of the five estates under Phase 6B. The suspension of the HOS was announced at the same time.

In June 2004, phase 6A was announced for a total of about 25,000 units: the authority would sell 5,100 flats in Cheung Wah Estate in Fanling in June; flats in Lei Tung Estate, Po Lam Estate and Shan King Estate will be sold in stages by the end of 2004.

In May 2005, the Government announced the estates which would be in 6B, the final phase of the Tenants Purchase Scheme. 23,451 flats under the Housing Authority, comprising Cheung Fat Estate in Tsing Yi, Fu Shin Estate in Tai Po, Long Ping Estate in Yuen Long, Nam Cheong Estate in Sham Shui Po, and Tsui Lam Estate in Tseung Kwan O would be set for sale by the end of 2006.

Three of these alcohols, 2-methyl-1-butanol, 2-pentanol, and 3-methyl-2-butanol (methyl isopropyl carbinol), contain stereocenters, and are therefore chiral and optically active.

The most important amyl alcohol is isoamyl alcohol, the chief one generated by fermentation in the production of alcoholic beverages and a constituent of fusel oil. The other amyl alcohols may be obtained synthetically.

"Thomas Creighton was a prospector who found mineral deposits in Saskatchewan.

With his partners Jack and Dan Mosher, Creighton discovered gold on the west side of Amisk Lake in 1913. This was the first significant mineral in the area, leading to an influx of more than a thousand men and women from all over Canada. By 1914 a row of tents and log cabins, along with two cookhouses capable of feeding two hundred people at a time, developed at a place known as ""Beaver City"". Soon a freighting business was set up, then barns and boarding houses were also built to look after the many travellers. With the gold rush, the freighting industry, and the fishing industry, the boom town Beaver City seemed sustainable. However, when the First World War broke out, many left or moved to Sturgeon Landing to find work in the Mandy Mine there. Beaver City began to deteriorate, and by 1918 had practically become a ghost town.

One day whilst wandering in the wilderness he came upon a copy of The Sunless City by  J. E. Preston Muddock. The story is about a man named Josiah Flintabbatey Flonatin ""Flin Flon"", who piloted a submarine through a bottomless lake. Upon passing through a hole lined with gold, he found a strange underground world. When Tom Creighton discovered a rich vein of almost pure copper, he thought of the book and called it Flin Flon.

The town of Creighton was founded in the 1930s, when some twenty homes were built on either side of the winter trail between Flin Flon and Sandy Bay (Denare). The community grew somewhat after the Saskatchewan Department of Natural Resources constructed a road from Flin Flon to Amisk Lake.

A commemorative cairn to Thomas Creighton is located on Main Street near Creighton School. In 1978, the National Film Board of Canada produced the short documentary Canada Vignettes: Flin Flon about the origin of the city's name.

"In card games, a burn card is a playing card dealt from the top of a deck, and discarded (""burned""), unused by the players. Burn cards are usually not shown to the players.

Burning is most often performed in casinos to deter a form of cheating known as card marking. In poker, for example, the top card of the deck stub is burned at the beginning of each betting round, so that players who might have been able to read markings on that card during the previous round are less able to take advantage of that information. Knowledge of a burn card might be marginally useful, such as knowing there is one fewer Ace in the deck, but far less so than knowing it is about to be in play.

Two other uses for burning are: to prevent second dealing and to provide extra cards for use when an irregularity of play occurs.  Sometimes a misdealt card (such as one of the down cards in poker that has flashed during the deal) will be used as the burn card – in those cases, the card should be immediately placed face up on the deck after the deal is complete.

When Texas hold 'em (as well as in Omaha hold 'em) is played in casinos (or other formal games where cheating is a concern), a card is burned before dealing the flop, turn, and river, for a maximum of 3 total burn cards.

"The white currant is a group of cultivars of the red currant (""Ribes rubrum""), a species of flowering plant in the family Grossulariaceae, native to Europe.  It is a deciduous shrub growing to 1 m tall and broad, with palmate leaves, and masses of spherical, edible fruit (berries) in summer.  The white currant differs from the red currant only in the colour and flavour of these fruits, which are a translucent white and sweeter. Pentadiplandra brazzeana is an evergreen shrub or liana that is the only species assigned to the genus Pentadiplandra, and has been placed in a family of its own called Pentadiplandraceae.  It produces large red berries, sometimes mottled with grey.  It is known from West-Central Tropical Africa, between northern Angola, eastern Nigeria and western Democratic Republic of Congo.  The berry is sweet in taste due to the protein, brazzein, which is substantially sweeter than saccharose.  Brazzein may be useful as a low-calorie sweetener, but is not yet allowed as a food additive in the United States and the European Union. In terms of mixed drinks, shrub is the name of two different, but related, acidulated beverages.  One type of shrub is a fruit liqueur that was popular in 17th and 18th century England, typically made with rum or brandy mixed with sugar and the juice or rinds of citrus fruit. Jagertee (also Jägertee) is an alcoholic beverage made by mixing overproof rum with black tea, red wine, plum brandy, orange juice and various spices.

"Rafiqul Alam () (born 4 October 1957) is a former Bangladeshi cricketer who played in two One Day Internationals in the 1986 Asia Cup. In his debut match against Pakistan he scored 14. He followed this with 10 against Sri Lanka.

In ICC Trophy
He was a member of the Bangladesh team that took part in the 2nd ICC Trophy tournament in England. He played in all 7 matches (including the semi-Final against eventual champions Zimbabwe). Alam, however, failed to impress and scored only 79 runs. His highest was 33 in the very first match against West Africa.

He was slightly more successful four years later. He scored 135 runs with an average of 27.00. His top score was 51 against Malaysia. He also took 5 wickets in the tournament.

Innings against Omar Qureshi XI
Rafiqul Alam is best remembered for his sterling 86 against Omar Qureshi XI, a team of Pakistani players led by Imran Khan in January 1986.

In domestic cricket
From the late 1970s until the early 1990s, Rafiqul Alam was one of the most consistent performers in domestic cricket arena. Unfortunately, he failed to achieve the same consistency in international arena. Nevertheless, many analysts still consider him one of the best Bangladeshi cricketer of the 1980s.

After retirement
After serving as junior national selector in the 1990s, Rafiqul Alam concentrated on coaching club sides. He was the successful head coach of Kalabagan Krira Chakra in the late 1990s and 2000, 2001 and 2002. In 2007, he became chief national team selector. He has also been the coaching director of Dhanmondi Cricket Academy since its inception.

"Borgholzhausen is a town in the district of Gütersloh in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. It is located in the Teutoburg Forest, approx. 20 km north-west of Bielefeld.

Borgholzhausen is a sister city to New Haven, Missouri in the Missouri Rhineland of the United States.

Geography and early history 
Borgholzhausen is located in a clearing in the Teutoburg Forest, on the northern edge of the Westphalian Plain. The mountain range roughly bisects the city area NW-SE and is in turn bisected by the mountain pass where the town of Borgholzhausen was founded. The mountainous part of the Borgholzhausen area generally reaches elevations of 200–300 meters above sea level, while the pass area and other lower-lying parts are less than half that elevation.

The town center is about one kilometer east of the Johannisegge mountain and south of the Hankenüll mountain. The northern parts of Borgholzhausen are in the Ravensberger mountains, while the south is in the Münsterland. The bedrock in the former part is a thick layer mainly of Cretaceous sediments, while the latter has a less thick layer of generally Mesozoic rocks covering the trunk of a Paleozoic mountain range.

The Borgholzhausen pass was an important route for crossing the Teutoburg Forest in the Bronze Age. As early as 1,500 B.C. The pass area was populated across the board. Numerous urn field cemeteries have been excavated in and around the city.

"A Mimosa is a cocktail composed of equal parts champagne (or other sparkling wine) and chilled citrus juice, usually orange juice unless otherwise specified (e.g., a grapefruit juice mimosa).  It is traditionally served in a tall champagne flute at brunch, at weddings, or as part of first class service on some passenger railways and airlines. A Whisky Macdonald more commonly known under the shortened name Whisky Mac is a cocktail made up of whisky and ginger wine.  The whisky is expected to be a Scotch whisky, usually a blended type.  The ginger wine should be green ginger wine.  Recipes vary from those having equal parts of each ingredient to those that use a ratio of 3 to 2 of whisky to wine. Ginger wine is a fortified wine made from a fermented blend of ground ginger root and raisins which was first produced in England.  It is often fortified by being blended with brandy (especially cognac).  Ginger wine can be drunk with ice (""on the rocks""), or without ice (either ""neat"" or ""straight up""), and is frequently used as an ingredient—along with whisky (typically a blended Scotch whisky)—in a ""Whisky Mac"" (the shortened form of ""Whisky Macdonald"").

"In mathematics, the Cartan–Dieudonné theorem, named after Élie Cartan and Jean Dieudonné, establishes that every orthogonal transformation in an n-dimensional symmetric bilinear space can be described as the composition of at most n reflections.

The notion of a symmetric bilinear space is a generalization of Euclidean space whose structure is defined by a symmetric bilinear form (which need not be positive definite, so is not necessarily an inner product – for instance, a pseudo-Euclidean space is also a symmetric bilinear space). The orthogonal transformations in the space are those automorphisms which preserve the value of the bilinear form between every pair of vectors; in Euclidean space, this corresponds to preserving distances and angles. These orthogonal transformations form a group under composition, called the orthogonal group.

For example, in the two-dimensional Euclidean plane, every orthogonal transformation is either a reflection across a line through the origin or a rotation about the origin (which can be written as the composition of two reflections). Any arbitrary composition of such rotations and reflections can be rewritten as a composition of no more than 2 reflections. Similarly, in three-dimensional Euclidean space, every orthogonal transformation can be described as a single reflection, a rotation (2 reflections), or an improper rotation (3 reflections). In four dimensions, double rotations are added that represent 4 reflections.

Formal statement 
Let  be an n-dimensional, non-degenerate symmetric bilinear space over a field with characteristic not equal to 2. Then, every element of the orthogonal group  is a composition of at most n reflections.

"Mortenson Lake National Wildlife Refuge is located in southern Albany County in the U.S. state of Wyoming and includes 1,776 acres (7.2 km2). The refuge is managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service an agency within the U.S. Department of the Interior. Mortensen Lake NWR is a high altitude refuge and has several small alpine lakes of which Mortenson Lake is the largest. At 7,256 feet (2,211 m) above sea level, the refuge provides protection for numerous migratory bird species.

In 1984, the Wyoming Toad was listed as an endangered species and was widely believed to be extinct in the wild. A small population of the toad was rediscovered in 1987 in the area surrounding Mortenson Lake which led to the establishment of the refuge in 1993. Since 1995, offspring from captured examples of this extremely rare amphibian have been released into the wild to help stabilize the remaining population. The refuge is closed to all public access to aid in recovery efforts of this endangered species.

Mortenson NWR is administered by Arapaho National Wildlife Refuge in Colorado.

"The critical philosophy () movement, attributed to Immanuel Kant (1724–1804), sees the primary task of philosophy as criticism rather than justification of knowledge. Criticism, for Kant, meant judging as to the possibilities of knowledge before advancing to knowledge itself (from the Greek kritike (techne), or ""art of judgment""). The basic task of philosophers, according to this view, is not to establish and demonstrate theories about reality, but rather to subject all theories—including those about philosophy itself—to critical review, and measure their validity by how well they withstand criticism.

""Critical philosophy"" is also used as another name for Kant's philosophy itself. Kant said that philosophy's proper inquiry is not about what is out there in reality, but rather about the character and foundations of experience itself. We must first judge how human reason works, and within what limits, so that we can afterwards correctly apply it to sense experience and determine whether it can be applied at all to metaphysical objects.

The principal three sources on which the critical philosophy is based are the three critiques, namely Critique of Pure Reason, Critique of Practical Reason and Critique of Judgement, published between 1781 and 1790 and mostly concerned, respectively, with metaphysics, ethics and aesthetics.

"Nicholas Joseph Swarbrick (14 November 1898 – 2 February 2006) was, at age 107, the final surviving English merchant sailor of the First World War at the time of his death.

He was born in Grimsargh, near Preston in Lancashire, where his father was a farmer. His mother died of tuberculosis when he was only six and he was later to lose his only sister from the same illness. He was only four when she first fell ill and, as she was infectious, he was not able to come near her because of her coughing. His elder (by 11 years) sister was forced to run the household.

He attended Winckley Square School, a Jesuit school in Preston, but dropped out at 14 after being administered especially severe corporal punishment.

As a radio officer in the Merchant Navy, he made several transatlantic crossings to transport horses and troops. He left the Navy in 1929 to help his father's business, later taking up an interest in cattle breeding.

He never married and died in his native Grimsargh on 2 February 2006, aged 107.

"Tiny Sepuku is a syndicated weekly comic strip created by Ken Cursoe based around a character named Tiny Sepuku (usually addressed simply as ""Tiny"" by readers - every question starts with the salutation ""Dear Tiny"") who answers questions from his readers and generally dispenses love advice.

Publication history 
Tiny Sepuku began in 1997 as a parody of Hello Kitty, and achieved success in alternative weeklies by the year 2000. Tiny Sepuku has been distributed by Universal Press Syndicate/Universal Uclick/Andrews McMeel Syndication since April 3, 2003.

Background
The humor is occasionally self-parodying where the author may make light of his own experiences, and it is frequently cynical on the topic of love. Nevertheless, the comic occasionally dispenses semi-serious advice and explores relationship issues. Among the recurring cast of characters is a cat resembling the Hello Kitty character, along with a bunch of other drawings which frequently act out the adult situations in the letters. One common technique used in the strip is to suggest a variety of possible reactions and ways to deal with a situation, and have the characters act out each one.

Theming

Mysterious Island is a recreation of the fictitious one in Jules Verne's novel, The Mysterious Island, which serves as Captain Nemo's lair. It is also known as Vulcania Island, as featured in the Disney movie 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. When guests enter the area, they discover Nemo's secret base, complete with a harbor for his Nautilus, as well as a lab inside the volcano, known as Mount Prometheus. Nemo is exploring the depths of the sea and of the earth, which allows guests to experience two of Verne's most famous adventures: 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea and Journey to the Center of the Earth.

Despite its name, Mysterious Island is not an actual island. It is instead built into the side of Mount Prometheus. This volcano is ""active"" (bursts of fire can be seen escaping from the top, bursts of steam from cracks in its side, and bursts of water from the lake). The area has some greenery, and is mostly rocks and ornaments (as one can see in the film).

"Orange is an electoral district of the Legislative Assembly in the Australian state of New South Wales. It is a regional electorate that covers four local government areas in their entirety: the City of Orange, Cabonne Council, Parkes Shire and Forbes Shire. 

The seat has been held by Philip Donato since a by-election in November 2016. Donato was initially elected as a member of the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party but resigned in 2022 and became an Independent.

History
The electorate of Orange was created in 1859. Between 1920 and 1927, Orange and Hartley were absorbed into Bathurst, which elected three members under proportional representation. In 1927, Bathurst, Hartley and Orange were recreated as single-member electorates.

The area leans strongly toward the National Party. The Labor Party hasn't held the seat since 1947, although it came close to winning at a 1996 by-election. The Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party won the seat at the 2016 by-election, after Andrew Gee resigned to successfully contest the federal electorate of Calare.

"The Jakarta Declaration on Leading Health Promotion into the 21st Century is the name of an international agreement that was signed at the World Health Organization's 1997 Fourth International Conference on Health Promotion held in Jakarta. The declaration reiterated the importance of the agreements made in the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion, and added emphasis to certain aspects of health promotion.

About the Declaration
The Jakarta Declaration included the following five ""priorities for health promotion in the 21st century"":
1. ""Promote social responsibility for health""
2. ""Increase investments for health development""
3. ""Consolidate and expand partnerships for health""
4. ""increase community capacity and empower the individual""
5. ""Secure an infrastructure for health promotion""

The declaration recognizes that"":
 Participation is necessary for change.
 Health literacy is essential for participation - emphasizes the need for access to education and information and hence, the empowerment of individuals and communities.
 Combinations of five strategies for health promotion -- ""build healthy public policy"", ""create supportive environments"", ""strengthen community action"", ""develop personal skills"", and ""reorient health services""—are more effective than ""single-track approaches"".

Promotion of the Declaration
In the United Kingdom, the central message of the Jakarta declaration is similar to the government's current health policy. That is the emphasis on infrastructure and investment, with the hope of empowering the service user with choice.

"Civil Liberty is a fundraising organisation for ""UK nationalists"", that was run by members of the far-right British National Party (BNP) and British Democratic Party (BDP). It has been described as a front organisation.

Organisation 
Civil Liberty was set up by Kevin Scott, who was a regional organiser for the BNP until 2006. Scott has continued to run the organisation. An investigation by The Guardian established that the group's address was registered to Tyneside BNP, and its website domain was registered at the address of the BNP's website editor. Its national treasurer was the BNP's head of administration. The group raises money to support nationalists, and was set up to ""monitor anti-white racism"". The anti-fascist group Hope not Hate described the group as a ""fake 'civil rights' organisation"" and argued that its claim to support individuals ""who have fallen victim to the tyranny of government"" to only apply to white people. Scott has since joined the British Democratic Party, a BNP breakaway group founded by former Member of the European Parliament (MEP) and National Front chairman Andrew Brons.

Fundraising in the United States 
Nick Griffin, the then leader of the BNP, was recorded at a conference organised by a former member of the Ku Klux Klan in the United States calling for American supporters of the party to give money to Civil Liberty rather than the BNP because of laws against international donations. He said the group ""helps members of the BNP and that is within the law"". Following publication of The Guardian's investigation, the Metropolitan Police's Domestic Extremism Unit started an inquiry into the link between Civil Liberty and the BNP.

"Blue Card Services administers the blue card system—Queensland’s Working with Children Check.

The blue card system is used in Queensland, Australia as a prevention and monitoring system for people working with children and young people. Other states in Australia have a similar working with children check, but are not called a ""blue card"".

Purpose 
All children in Queensland have a right to be safe and protected from harm. The blue card system regulates activities that are essential to children’s lives. These include childcare, education, sport, cultural activities and foster care. We check and monitor people who work in these industries and help organisations to create safe environments for children.

The blue card system is regulated by 2 pieces of legislation: the Working with Children (Risk Management and Screening) Act 2000 (the act) and the Working with Children (Risk Management and Screening) Regulation 2020.

The blue card system contributes to the creation of safe service environments for children in various ways. Just as each piece of a jigsaw comes together to make a complete picture, the same applies to the blue card system. The different parts all play an essential role in keeping children and young people safe and it works best when all parts work together.

The 4 components of the blue card system involve:

 Who needs a blue card?
 The blue card check.
 Ongoing daily monitoring and compliance with blue card requirements.
 Requirements to develop and implement a child and youth risk management strategy.

"Kirkuk Olympic Stadium () is a multi-use stadium in Kirkuk, Iraq.  It is currently used mostly for football matches and it also has an athletics track. The stadium holds 25,000.

The stadium was built in 1982 for an Olympics that never happened.

The stadium refurbishment is being done in two phases. First the stadium is being comprehensively rebuilt. Phase two will augment the facilities.

After the fall of the Saddam Hussein regime in 2003, at least 500 Kurds who had been displaced returned to Kirkuk and settled in the stadium. The families lived in the stadium for more than six years before moving on.

Subsequently, the stadium underwent renovations costing approximately 20 billion Iraqi dinars (around 11.7 million euros) and was expanded to include a hotel and two training grounds, among other additions. The construction works were funded by the Iraqi Ministry of Youth and Sports. The project began in 2011, with the initial completion date set for 2015. In January 2020, the budget for the project was increased to 33.5 billion dinars (approximately 25.2 million euros).

"Pseuderanthemum reticulatum, common names Yellow-Vein Eranthemum and Golden Pseuderanthemum , is a species of evergreen shrub in the Acanthaceae family. Enkianthus is a genus of shrubs or small trees in the heath family (Ericaceae).  Its native range is in Asia, as far west as the eastern Himalayas, as far south as Indochina, and as far north and east as China and Japan. Eranthemum pulchellum (""Eranthemum nervosum"", English: blue eranthemum, or blue sage) is a strongly branched shrub, popular with gardeners in tropical India and China because of the spikes of flowers that are bright gentian blue - an unusual color in the tropics.  The flowers appear from green-and-white veined bracts that remain after the blooms fall, forming a column several inches long.  The hairy leaves are large and dark green.  A sprawling shrub which may reach a metre or more in height, ""E. pulchellum"" is usually kept lower and bushier through pruning.  Light shade is preferred in a garden; in a greenhouse it needs warm conditions.  It is easily propagated from cuttings.  According to ITIS, ""Eranthemum pulchellum"" is the only species in the genus Eranthemum although The Plant List accepts 22 species.",Answer the following question based on the context: What do Eranthemum and Enkianthus have in common?,

"NGC 1309 is a spiral galaxy located approximately 120 million light-years away, appearing in the constellation Eridanus. It is about 75,000 light-years across, and is about 3/4s the width of the Milky Way. Its shape is classified as SA(s)bc, meaning that it has moderately wound spiral arms and no ring.
Bright blue areas of star formation can be seen in the spiral arms, while the yellowish central nucleus contains older-population stars. NGC 1309 is one of over 200 members of the Eridanus Group of galaxies.

Supernova 2002fk
SN 2002fk was discovered jointly by Reiki Kushida of the Yatsugatake South Base Observatory, Nagano Prefecture, Japan; and Jun-jie Wang and Yu-Lei Qiu of the Beijing Astronomical Observatory on Sept. 17.719 UT.
When it was discovered it was magnitude ~15.0; it was estimated to have reached maximum magnitude of ~13.0 before fading away. It was a Type Ia supernova (i.e., the progenitor star was white dwarf). White dwarfs are older stars that have used up almost all of their main fuel (the lighter elements such as hydrogen and helium). SN 2002fk's spectra showed no indications of hydrogen, helium or carbon; instead ionized calcium, silicon, iron and nickel were found.

Supernova 2012Z

SN 2012Z was discovered jointly by S. B. Cenko, W. Li, and A. V. Filippenko using the Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope on January 29.15 UT as part of the Lick Observatory Supernova Search. The scientists have hypothesized that this is a type Iax supernova, and may have left behind a remnant zombie star. In February 2022 a study with new observations has confirmed that the star survived the explosion and is even brighter than before.

"The foreign relations of Angola are based on Angola's strong support of U.S. foreign policy as the Angolan economy is dependent on U.S. foreign aid.
From 1975 to 1989, Angola was aligned with the Eastern bloc, in particular the Soviet Union, Libya, and Cuba. Since then, it has focused on improving relationships with Western countries, cultivating links with other Portuguese-speaking countries, and asserting its own national interests in Central Africa through military and diplomatic intervention. In 1993, it established formal diplomatic relations with the United States. It has entered the Southern African Development Community as a vehicle for improving ties with its largely Anglophone neighbors to the south. Zimbabwe and Namibia joined Angola in its military intervention in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where Angolan troops remain in support of the Joseph Kabila government. It also has intervened in the Republic of the Congo (Brazzaville) in support of Denis Sassou-Nguesso in the civil war.

Since 1998, Angola has successfully worked with the United Nations Security Council to impose and carry out sanctions on UNITA. More recently, it has extended those efforts to controls on conflict diamonds, the primary source of revenue for UNITA during the Civil War that ended in 2002. At the same time, Angola has promoted the revival of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries (CPLP) as a forum for cultural exchange and expanding ties with Portugal (its former ruler) and Brazil (which shares many cultural affinities with Angola) in particular.

The album was banned by several major retailers including HMV due to its sexually explicit title and cover art. Under the direction of James Anderton copies were seized, along with other records by Crass and Dead Kennedys, by Greater Manchester Police from Eastern Bloc record shop, who were charged with displaying ""Obscene Articles For Publication For Gain"". The album's lyrical content concerned violence between men and women, based on the experiences of a band member who had been sexually assaulted. The title was a Dada-style ploy to get attention for this social message. The band, its two record labels and its publishing company were also charged under the Obscene Publications Act, but all charges were dropped.

The album also featured artwork by Crass guitarist Andy Palmer.

The Fucking Cunts... reached number two on the UK Indie Chart, spending fifteen weeks on the chart in total. It was reissued in 1986 on band member Derek Birkett's own One Little Indian label.

"Nigel Irens RDI is a leading yacht designer. Amongst his designs are the Adventurer, a 35m trimaran motor yacht which completed a record-breaking circumnavigation in 1998, and   a 23 m sailing trimaran used by Ellen MacArthur to break the world record for solo circumnavigation in 2005.

His design portfolio is wide-ranging, from record-breaking yachts to innovative cruising designs such as Roxane, and other sailing designs of traditional appearance such as the Westernman cutters – designed in association with the late Ed Burnett – or the launch Rangeboat, a 12m power craft also of traditional appearance. Typically, Irens' designs synthesise traditional forms with modern materials and methods of construction, with Carbon fibre masts, laminated frames, and epoxied strip wood strongly in evidence.

For a while, when beginning his career as a yacht designer, Ed Burnett worked for Irens, and that led to a number of successful collaborations. They worked together on designs such as Zinnia, a 30ft gaff cutter, Kilrush Nomad II, a 43ft gaff cutter, and the King Alfred dinghy to be built by King Alfred School in London. By 2012, the school had built three, and use them to introduce students to dinghy cruising.

Irens is perhaps particularly noteworthy for the simplicity, efficiency, and, essential elegance of his design.

Polish versions of the locomotive bore some improvements and changes compared with German ones, and were similar to PKP class Ty23. Ok22 locomotives were the first on the PKP to be equipped with electric lights.

Wartime
After the German invasion of Poland in World War II, most Ok22 locomotives were taken into the Deutsche Reichsbahn fleet as 38 4501 to 38 4630.

Present day
Only two examples have survived. Ok22-23 in Jaworzyna Śląska and Ok22-31 in Wolsztyn. Ok22-31 was an operational engine. It ran until 1997, and after retirement became a stationary exhibit. In 2004 the machine was restored to working order again, and it ran until 2009. It is currently static.

"Leviathan (Russian: Левиафан , ""Leviafan"") is a 2014 Russian drama film directed by Andrey Zvyagintsev, co-written by Zvyagintsev and Oleg Negin, and starring Aleksei Serebryakov, Elena Lyadova, and Vladimir Vdovichenkov.  According to Zvyagintsev, the story of Marvin Heemeyer in the United States inspired him and it was adapted into a Russian setting, but critics compare the story to the more similar biblical story of Naboth's Vineyard, where a King vies for his subjects' land and is motivated by his Queen to obtain it in a sly manner.  The character development of the protagonist parallels another biblical figure, Job.  The producer Alexander Rodnyansky has said: ""It deals with some of the most important social issues of contemporary Russia while never becoming an artist's sermon or a public statement; it is a story of love and tragedy experienced by ordinary people"".  Critics noted the film as being formidable, dealing with quirks of fate, power and money.

"The Standards Department was a department of the English Board of Trade having the custody of the imperial standards of weights and measures.

History
As far back as can be traced, the standard weights and measures, the primary instruments for determining the justness of all other weights and measures used in the United Kingdom, were kept at the Exchequer, and the duties relating to these standards were imposed upon the chamberlains of the Exchequer. The office of chamberlains was abolished in 1826 using the Receipt of the Exchequer Act 1783, but the custody of the standards and any duties connected to them remained attached to an officer in the Exchequer until that department was abolished by the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act 1866. Meanwhile, in pursuance of recommendations of Standard Commissions of 1841 and 1854 and a House of Commons committee of 1862, the Standards of Weights, Measures, and Coinage Act 1866 was passed. This act created a special department of the Board of Trade, called the Standard Weights and Measures Department, and a head of that department styled the Warden of the Standards. His duty was to conduct comparisons, verifications and operations with reference to the standards in aid of scientific research and otherwise.

Directors

 Henry Williams Chisholm, warden of the standards (1866–1878), father of Hugh Chisholm
 Henry James Chaney (March 1842–13 February 1906), superintendent of weights and measures (1878–1906)

Hepburn (1891 – 16 July 1971) was a Scottish businessman, a joint founder, along with Herbert Ross, of the Hepburn and Ross whisky blending company, which was the first to blend the popular Red Hackle whisky (blended today by Lang Brothers).  The prosperity that Hepburn and Ross' enterprise brought Charles Hepburn allowed him to become a well known Glasgow patron of the arts, with him amassing a large collection of literature and books in particular.  He also collected various paintings, furniture, arms and armour, as well as oriental rugs.

He became a benefactor to the University of Glasgow, for which he was given an honorary doctorate in law in 1964.  He was also involved with the Glasgow Zoo (as was his colleague Herbert Ross), of which he became president.  He is widely credited for reviving the fortunes of the zoo in the late 1950s and early 1960s by renovating it and donating some of his own money to this end.

Hepburn died on 16 July 1971.  He bequeathed to Glasgow University a large number of books and manuscripts, some 300 in total, which are now held there as the Hepburn Bequest.  He also left a house to the university, which is now known as Hepburn House, and fittingly, given Hepburn's commitment to the arts, houses the university's History of Art Department.

"In baseball statistics, total bases (TB) is the number of bases a player has gained with hits. It is a weighted sum for which the weight value is 1 for a single, 2 for a double, 3 for a triple and 4 for a home run. Only bases attained from hits count toward this total. Reaching base by other means (such as a base on balls) or advancing further after the hit (such as when a subsequent batter gets a hit) does not increase the player's total bases.

The total bases divided by the number of at bats is the player's slugging average.

Hank Aaron is the career leader in total bases with 6,856. Albert Pujols (6,211), Stan Musial (6,134), and Willie Mays (6,080) are the only other players with at least 6,000 career total bases.

"In Alaska, the Bush typically refers to any region of the state that is not connected to the North American road network or does not have ready access to the state's ferry system.  A large proportion of Alaska Native populations live in the Bush, often depending on subsistence hunting and fishing.

Geographically, the Bush comprises the Alaska North Slope; Northwest Arctic; West, including the Baldwin and Seward Peninsulas; the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta; Southwest Alaska; Bristol Bay; Alaska Peninsula; and remote areas of the Alaska Panhandle and Interior. 

Some of the hub communities in the bush, which typically can be reached by larger, commercial airplanes, include Bethel, Dillingham, King Salmon, Nome, Utqiagvik,  Kodiak Island, Kotzebue, and Unalaska-Dutch Harbor.

Most parts of Alaska that are off the road or ferry system can be reached by small bush airplanes. Travel between smaller communities or to and from hub communities is typically accomplished by snowmobiles, boats, or ATVs.

"Nasir Ahmed (born 1 January 1964) is a Bangladeshi former cricketer who played in seven One Day Internationals from 1988 to 1990. He is one of the three best wicketkeepers to play for Bangladesh, Shafiq-ul-Haq and Khaled Mashud being the other two. After the retirement of Haque, the selectors tried a number of young keepers, and Nasir (commonly known as Nasu) emerged as the most competent one. After cementing his place in 1986, he was a regular in the national side until 1993.

He eventually lost his place mainly due to tactical reasons, not for any keeping deficiencies. With one day game becoming more and more competitive, the team required a wicketkeeper who can bat up the order. Other players fulfilled this criterion better than Nasu. After retiring from cricket as a player, Nasu continued to serve the game as a national selector.

"Commelinales is an order of flowering plants. It comprises five families: Commelinaceae, Haemodoraceae, Hanguanaceae, Philydraceae, and Pontederiaceae. All the families combined contain over 885 species in about 70 genera; the majority of species are in the Commelinaceae. Plants in the order share a number of synapomorphies that tie them together, such as a lack of mycorrhizal associations and tapetal raphides. Estimates differ as to when the Commelinales evolved, but most suggest an origin and diversification sometime during the mid- to late Cretaceous. Depending on the methods used, studies suggest a range of origin between 123 and 73 million years, with diversification occurring within the group 110 to 66 million years ago. The order's closest relatives are in the Zingiberales, which includes ginger, bananas, cardamom, and others.

Taxonomy
According to the most recent classification scheme, the APG IV of 2016, the order includes five families:
 Commelinaceae
 Haemodoraceae
 Hanguanaceae
 Philydraceae
 Pontederiaceae

This is unchanged from the APG III of 2009 and the APG II of 2003, but different from the older APG system of 1998, which did not include Hanguanaceae.

Previous classification systems 
The older Cronquist system of 1981, which was based purely on morphological data, placed the order in subclass Commelinidae of class Liliopsida and included the families Commelinaceae, Mayacaceae, Rapateaceae and Xyridaceae. These families are now known to be only distantly related.
In the classification system of Dahlgren the Commelinales were one of four orders in the superorder Commeliniflorae (also called Commelinanae), and contained five families, of which only Commelinaceae has been retained by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group.

"Centrospermae is a descriptive botanical name, published in 1878 by Eichler, meaning ""with the seed in the center"", referring to the free (central) placentation. It was used in the Engler system and the Wettstein system) for an order of flowering plants.

In its  circumscription, Centrospermae corresponds fairly closely to the order Caryophyllales in the system of Cronquist. In the APG III system, and in later versions of the Kubitzki system, Caryophyllales is defined to include much more than Centrospermae.

Molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that Centrospermae is monophyletic. It is equivalent to a clade known as the core Caryophyllales, whenever the latter is defined to exclude the families Rhabdodendraceae, Simmondsiaceae, Physenaceae and Asteropeiaceae.

"Willys-Knight is an automobile that was produced between 1914 and 1933 by the Willys-Overland Company of Toledo, Ohio.

John North Willys purchased the Edwards Motor Car Company of Long Island, New York, in 1913, moving the operation to Elyria, Ohio, where Willys owned the plant that had previously manufactured the Garford automobile. Production began with a four-cylinder model which was priced in the $2,500 price range. The Willys-Knight employed a Knight sleeve valve engine, generally four- and six-cylinder models.

In 1915, Willys moved assembly of the Willys-Knight to Toledo, Ohio, but continued manufacturing the engines in Elyria. Willys-Knight introduced a sleeve-valve V8 in 1917, which was sold until 1919.

Willys-Knight enjoyed a production run average of 50,000 cars per year after 1922. Willys also purchased Stearns-Knight of Cleveland, Ohio, which also used a sleeve valve Knight Engine, making that marque the crown jewel in his growing automotive empire.

Willys-Knight production ended in November 1932 (model year 1933) when the company, in receivership, stopped building higher priced cars, and instead focused on the manufacture of the inexpensive but durable Willys 77.

Seven Willys-Knight vehicles including two large trucks and a touring car were used on the Martin and Osa Johnson photographic safari in the remotest areas of Africa.

"Pierre-Alexis ""Pitre"" Tremblay (December 27, 1827 – January 4, 1879) was a surveyor and Quebec political figure. He was a Liberal Member of Parliament from 1867 to 1875 and 1878 to 1879.

He was born in La Malbaie, Lower Canada, in 1827 and studied at the Petit Séminaire of Quebec. Near the end of 1853, he began carrying out surveys in the Saguenay region. As a journalist, he contributed to a number of newspapers of the time: Le Canadien, La Nation, Le National, L’Événement and L’Éclaireur. He was elected to Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada for Chicoutimi—Saguenay in an 1865 by-election.

In 1867, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Quebec in Chicoutimi-Saguenay; in the same year he was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the same riding; such dual mandates were legal at the time.  He was re-elected provincially in 1871 in the same seat, and in 1872 he was elected in Charlevoix federally. He resigned from the Quebec seat in 1874 when holding seats in both legislatures became illegal. His election in Charlevoix was invalidated in August 1875. He was defeated in a by-election held in 1876 but was able to overturn this result in the Supreme Court of Canada in 1877 by demonstrating that the Quebec clergy had exerted undue influence against him during the election. He represented Charlevoix federally from 1878 until his death in Quebec City in 1879.

From 1862 to 1868, he was involved with Félicité Angers, better known as the author Laure Conan, but he married Mary Ellen Connoly in 1870.

It is native to the Mojave Desert straddling the border between California and Nevada.  It grows in rocky and sandy desert habitat, often on alkaline soils.  This is an annual herb producing an erect, branching stem which may reach 1.5 meters in height.  The leaf is made up of three thick, firm leaflets 2 to 6 centimeters long, borne on a stout, straight petiole.  The inflorescence is a dense head of flowers clustered about the stem at the leaf axils, each flower with four small yellow petals.  The fruit is a small white or purple nutlet bearing the spine-like remnant of the flower receptacle.

"The National League for Liberty in Vaccination () is a French anti-vaccine advocacy organization which opposes all government vaccine requirements. It was formed in 1954 to oppose tuberculosis vaccines. The organization denies the benefits of vaccinations while promoting misinformation about their dangers.

History 
The LNPLV refers to a tradition from the end of the 19th century, ""the Universal League of Antivaccinators"" (or ""the International League of Antivaccinators"" founded by the Belgian ophthalmologist, Dr Hubert Boëns (1825-1898) in 1880), which represented a scholarly ""anti-vaccinism"" bringing together only doctors and personalities, holding international congresses (Cologne 1881, Charleroi 1885). The action of this current aimed to postpone the obligation of vaccination against smallpox in France (Liouville 1880 bill) until the vote of the law of 1902.

Under the title of National League against the obligation of vaccinations, the association was founded in 1954, by a merger of three groups opposed to the vaccination obligation extended to BCG in 1950:

“Health and Freedom” League, founded in 1948 by  of the Natural History Museum;

Association of Parents of Vaccination Victims;

people from the “” movement, led by .

The founder is Marcel Lemaire, father and non-doctor, who refused BCG for his child in 1952, and who was fined.

The association also brings together hygienist movements advocating fasting, vegetarianism... as well as the current of . The magazine of the association then bore the title Vaccination or Health until 1966, to become Health, freedom and vaccinations.

This is a very diverse genus and within a species individuals can look quite different, especially in harsh environments where they experience stress and remain small and stunted.  Also, they hybridize easily with each other.  Identifying an individual can be challenging.  In general these are rhizomatous perennials which may grow in rocky areas or in soil.  Their leaves are multiply pinnate, in that each leaflet is divided into smaller parts.  The sori are usually rounded and are covered in an inflated bladder-like indusium. Gymnocarpium is a small genus of ferns, called oak ferns.  It was once placed with various other groups, including the dryopteroid ferns and the athyrioid ferns.  Cladistic analysis has demonstrated that ""Gymnocarpium"" and ""Cystopteris"" form a natural but relatively primitive clade that is basal to the asplenoid, thelypterioid, and athyrioid ferns comprehensively. Woodsia is a genus of lightfishes.","Answer the following question based on the context: Woodsia and Cystopteris, are a genus of what?",

"""American shot"" or ""cowboy shot"" is a translation of a phrase from French film criticism, , and refers to a medium-long (""knee"") film shot of a group of characters, who are arranged so that all are visible to the camera. The usual arrangement is for the actors to stand in an irregular line from one side of the screen to the other, with the actors at the end coming forward a little and standing more in profile than the others. The purpose of the composition is to allow complex dialogue scenes to be played out without changes in camera position. In some literature, this is simply referred to as a 3/4 shot.

One of the other main reasons why French critics called it ""American shot"" was its frequent use in the western genre. This was because a shot that started at knee level would reveal the weapon of a cowboy, usually holstered at their waist. It is actually the closest the camera can get to an actor while keeping both their face and their holstered gun in frame.

The French critics thought it was characteristic of American films of the 1930s or 1940s; however, it was mostly characteristic of cheaper American movies, such as Charlie Chan mysteries where people collected in front of a fireplace or at the foot of the stairs in order to explain what happened a few minutes ago.

Howard Hawks legitimized this style in his films, allowing characters to act, even when not talking, when most of the audience would not be paying attention. It became his trademark style.

History
Wollongong was created in 1904, replacing parts of Woronora and Illawarra. In 1920, with the introduction of proportional representation, it was absorbed into Wollondilly, along with Allowrie. In 1927, with the abolition of proportional representation, it was recreated, along with a new Illawarra electorate. In 1930, it was replaced by Bulli. In 1941, a new electorate of Wollongong-Kembla was created. This was split into Wollongong and Kembla in 1968. Wollongong has rarely been won by the right wing  party and in recent decades has become one of Labor's safest seats.

"Succoth-benoth or Succoth Benoth (, Booths of Daughters) was a Babylonian deity, one of the deities brought to the former kingdom of Samaria by the men of Babylon. In the ninth year of Hoshea, ""the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes"", resettling large numbers of population. (2 Kings 17:6)  
 
The ""men"" from each of these five cities (""national groups"" - NIV) made its own gods and set them up in the shrines of the land, mixing it with the worship of Jehovah. ""The men of Babylon made Succoth Benoth, the men of Cuthah made Nergal, the men of Hamath made Ashima, the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites ... Adrammelech and Anamelech."" (2 Kings 17:30-31) The Bible says that these deities were idols, although the Samaritans were not punished because they worshipped the God of the Israelites as well. Like Ashima, the identity of Succoth-benoth is unknown. Hayim Tawil noted that Bànitu (Akkadian: 𒁀𒉌𒌈 Ba.ni.TUM, ""the creaturess"") was an epithet of Ishtar in Nineveh, and postulated the name ""Succoth-benoth"" was a Hebrew rendition of a Neo-Babylonian or Neo-Assyrian divine name meaning ""the image of Bànitu"".

According to b. Sanhedrin, Succoth Benoth was a Hen; according to y. Avoda Zara, a Hen and her Chicks; thus associating this god with the astrological constellation Pleiades. According to commentators, either sukkot is a foreign word for ""hen"" and the phrase means ""hen of chicks"" or the entire phrase is a foreign word for ""hen"". Marcus Jastrow proposed that the phrase is native to Hebrew and should be read ""covering the young"".

"Pud Pud in Weird World (also known simply as Pud Pud) is a computer game published by Ocean Software in 1985 for the ZX Spectrum. It was written by Jonathan Smith. Smith was paid £1000 for Pud Pud by Ocean Software and was given a job at Ocean as a direct result of the game.

Plot

Pud Pud is trapped in Weird World and needs to escape. He must explore Weird World looking for ten puddings and avoiding the deadly kiss of Mrs Pud Pud.

Gameplay

The player controls Pud Pud (who resembles a round pudding with wings or feet depending on whether he's walking or flying) and must explore the mazelike Weird World. Pud Pud has a limited amount of energy which needs to be topped up by eating certain creatures that live in Weird World although other creatures, which drain his energy if eaten, must be avoided. If Pud Pud runs out of energy he loses one of his three lives.

Mrs Pud Pud occasionally appears on the screen and is similar to Pud Pud, but white and wearing high heels. If she touches Pud Pud he loses a life instantly, regardless of his energy status although the player will receive a bonus score based on how much energy was remaining when Mrs Pud Pud delivered her kiss.

Pud Pud can obtain an extra life by collecting all ten hidden puddings.

The puddings are spread randomly throughout the maze with only one being in the maze at a time. When all ten are collected, Pud Pud can escape Weird World.

"Josef, Baron von Mering (28 February 1849, in Cologne – 5 January 1908, at Halle an der Saale, Germany) was a German physician.

Working at the University of Strasbourg, Mering was the first person to discover (in conjunction with Oskar Minkowski) that one of the pancreatic functions is the production of insulin, a hormone which controls blood sugar levels.

Mering was curious about the pancreas, a comma shaped organ, situated between the stomach and the small intestine. In an effort to discover its function, he removed the organ from a dog. The dog was then noticed frequently urinating on the floor, although it was house trained. Mering realised that this was a symptom of diabetes and tested the urine, which was found to be high in sugar, confirming his suspicion.

Josef von Mering helped to discover barbiturates, a class of sedative drugs used for insomnia, epilepsy, anxiety, and anesthesia. In 1903, he published observations that barbital (then known as diethyl-barbituric acid) has sedative properties in humans. In 1904, he helped to launch barbital under the brand name Veronal. Veronal was the first commercially available barbiturate sedative in any country. Von Mering collaborated with the chemist Emil Fischer, who was also involved in the discovery of barbital.

"Burkina Faso has good relations with the European Union, African and certain Asian countries. France, the former colonial power, in particular, continues to provide significant aid and supports Compaoré's developing role as a regional powerbroker.

According to the U.S. State Department, ""U.S. relations with Burkina Faso are good but subject to strains in the past because of the Compaoré government's past involvement in arms trading and other sanctions-breaking activity."" Burkina Faso cut diplomatic ties with Taiwan in May 2018 (being the most populous state to do so in the 21st century) and the foreign ministry of China stated it approved of its decision.

Burkina Faso's relations with its West African neighbors have improved in recent years. Relations with Ghana, in particular, have warmed. President Compaoré had mediated a political crisis in Togo and helped to resolve the Tuareg conflict in Niger. Burkina maintains cordial relations with Libya, but recalled its in ambassador in 2017 over issues of treatment of migrants trying to reach Europe, and the reemergence of the slave trade there.

"Ernest Clarke Williamson (24 May 1890 – 30 April 1964) was an English football goalkeeper.

Career 
Born in Murton, County Durham, Williamson began his career at local sides before moving to London in 1913 to join Croydon Common. During World War I he served in the Royal Army Service Corps and also turned out for various teams as a guest, including over 120 appearances for Arsenal. After the war ended, Williamson officially signed for Arsenal, who had just been promoted to the First Division, for a £150 fee. After sharing the keeper's jersey with Stephen Dunn in 1919–20 he made it his own the following season, playing 33 of the Gunners' 42 matches in 1920–21, and only missing one match the season after that.

His consistency for Arsenal brought the attention of the England selectors, and he became Arsenal's first post-First World War international, playing in both of England's matches away to Sweden on 21 May and 24 May 1923. However, by this time his Arsenal place was under threat; after conceding fourteen goals first in five matches during 1922–23 he had been dropped in favour of Dunn, and later Jock Robson. In June 1923 he left Arsenal for free to go to Norwich City. In all he played 113 official first-class matches for Arsenal, in addition to his unofficial wartime matches.

After playing for Division Three South Norwich for two seasons, Williamson retired from football altogether in 1925. He died in 1964, aged 73.

It was abolished in 1894 and largely replaced by Robertson and Singleton. In 1904 Robertson was abolished and Upper Hunter was recreated. It was abolished from 1920 with the introduction of proportional representation, but was recreated in 1927.

Upper Hunter is one of three electorates to have never been held by the Labor Party and always by the conservative side of politics since the abolition of proportional representation in 1927, the other two being Tamworth and Oxley. The Nationals have held the district without interruption since 1931.

"The Sabancı family is one of the wealthiest families in Turkey according to the Forbes billionaires list of 2016, with an estimated fortune ranging between $20–30 billion. The family's main business entity was founded by Hacı Ömer Sabancı in the 1930s. Hacı Ömer Sabancı, the progenitor of the Sabancı family, moved from his native Kayseri to Adana in the early 1920s. His business grew, in part, due to reduced business competition as a result of the Armenian genocide.  Some second and third generation members of the family today control a group of companies under Sabancı Holding. Most of the companies were established by the efforts of the second generation members of the family, Sakıp Sabancı, Hacı Sabancı, Şevket Sabancı, Erol Sabancı, and Özdemir Sabancı . After the death of Sakıp Sabancı, also known as Sakip Aga, in 2004, the granddaughter of the founder, Güler Sabancı, was chosen to run Sabancı Holding.

Today, some second and third generation members of the family have left their managerial positions at the Sabanci Group and established their own companies such as Densa, Demsa and Esas Holding which owns Pegasus Airlines.

"Clorgiline (INN), or clorgyline (BAN), is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) structurally related to pargyline which is described as an antidepressant. Specifically, it is an irreversible and selective inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A). Clorgiline was never marketed, but it has found use in scientific research. It has been found to bind with high affinity to the σ1 receptor (Ki = 3.2 nM) and with very high affinity to the I2 imidazoline receptor (Ki = 40 pM).

Clorgiline is also a multidrug efflux pump inhibitor. Holmes et al., 2012 reverse azole fungicide resistance using clorgiline, showing promise for its use in multiple fungicide resistance.

"Hadashville is a small, unincorporated community in the Rural Municipality of Reynolds, in eastern Manitoba, Canada.

Hadashville is located in the Whitemouth River watershed north of the Sandilands Provincial Forest, about  east of Winnipeg on Highway 11, and  miles north of the Trans-Canada Highway. It has sandy soil, many farms, and is surrounded by the boreal forest. This Whitemouth River area is very close to the western edge of the Canadian Shield, and just north of the United States border.

The first settlements in the Hadashville area are believed to have been established about 1904. At that time, settlers received supplies from the nearest railway station near Whitemouth. The hamlet of Hadashville is named after Charles Hadash, who moved his family to the area after learning that a railway for the Greater Winnipeg Water District's (GWWD) Shoal Lake Aqueduct was planned. Hadash established the first post office in Hadashville along with a small store, pool room, and dance hall.

"Ammonius Grammaticus (; ) was a 4th-century Egyptian priest.

In 391, he was involved in a violent revolt centred at Alexandria's Serapeum, where the pagan rebels tortured and killed captured Christians. After the suppression of the revolt and the destruction of the temple, Ammonius fled to Constantinople, where he became the tutor of the ecclesiastical historian Socrates.

Ammonius was formerly identified as the  author of a treatise titled Peri homoíōn kai diaphórōn léxeōn (περὶ ὁμοίων καὶ διαφόρων λέξεων, On the Differences of Synonymous Expressions). But it seems more probable that the real author was Herennius Philo of Byblus, who was born during the reign of Nero and lived till the reign of Hadrian, and that the treatise in its present form is a revision prepared by a later Byzantine editor, whose name may have been Ammonius.

Approximately  long, it courses through northwest Iowa. The headwaters arise north of Marcus in Cherokee County () and flows generally southwest through farmland in Plymouth and Woodbury counties until the meandered (old) streambed finally meets the Little Sioux River near Turin in Monona County.

However, the lower portion of the river, where the stream leaves the Loess Hills and enters the Missouri River floodplain near Holly Springs, Iowa, has been extensively channelized. Across this floodplain, most of the flow is actually carried by the Garretson and West Fork drainage ditches, which join to become the Monona-Harrison Ditch, which in turn enters the Missouri just upstream from the mouth of the Little Sioux in Harrison County.

"Hermann III (c.994/995 - April 1, 1012) was a member of the Conradine dynasty. He was Duke of Swabia from 1003 until 1012.

Life
Hermann was the son of Herman II, Duke of Swabia and his wife Gerberga of Burgundy, daughter of Conrad I of Burgundy. He had many illustrious relatives. Through his father, Hermann was descended from Henry the Fowler; through his mother from Louis IV of France, Alfred the Great and Charlemagne. Hermann's sister, Gisela of Swabia, married Emperor Conrad II.

Inheritance and regency
In 1003, when Hermann was about nine years old, his father died and Hermann inherited the duchy of Swabia. Since he was a minor, Hermann's reign as duke was effectively controlled by his cousin, the King of Germany, Henry II, who was his guardian. Henry II was mistrustful of the Conradines. Herman III's father, Herman II, had opposed the election of Henry II as king of Germany in 1002, and promoted himself as a rival candidate for the throne. Henry II thus used his position as Hermann's guardian to limit the power of the dukes of Swabia. He took control of key places in Swabia himself (including Hohentwiel, Breisach and Zürich), and replaced the ducal mint with a royal mint. He separated Alsace from the duchy of Swabia and gave control of Alsace to one of his relatives, Count Gerhard. Henry's control over Swabia was still present when Hermann died, aged about eighteen, in 1012.

Hermann III did not marry and had no heirs. The male line of the Conradines of Swabia came to an end with his death. Henry III selected Ernest to succeed him; two years later, Ernest married Hermann's sister Gisela of Swabia.

"In human genetics, the Atlantic modal haplotype (AMH) or haplotype 15 is a Y chromosome haplotype of Y-STR microsatellite variations, associated with the Haplogroup R1b. It was discovered prior to many of the SNPs now used to identify subclades of R1b and references to it can be found in some of the older literature. It corresponds most closely with subclade R1b1a2a1a(1) [L11].  

The AMH is the most frequently occurring haplotype amongst human males in Atlantic Europe. It is characterized by the following marker alleles:
DYS388 12
DYS390 24
DYS391 11
DYS392 13
DYS393 13
DYS394 14 (also known as DYS19)

It reaches the highest frequencies in the Iberian Peninsula, in Great Britain and Ireland. In the Iberian Peninsula it reaches 70% in Portugal as a whole, more than 90% in NW Portugal and nearly 90% in Galicia (NW Spain), while the highest value is to be found among Spain and the Basques.

One mutation in either direction, would be AMH 1.15+. The AMH 1.15 set of haplotypes is also referred to as the Atlantic modal cluster or AMC.

"Peebles Rugby Football Club is a rugby union club based in Peebles in the Scottish Borders. The team currently competes in Scottish National League Division Two, the third tier of Scottish club rugby.

The earliest record available of rugby being played in Peebles was of a game in 1877 in Kingsmeadows Park and Peebles Rugby Football Club was formed in 1879. The club ceased to exist about 1900 but was re-constituted in 1923 and now play their home games at the Gytes.

Peebles is outwith the central Borders and was outside the main rugby playing towns of Galashiels, Melrose, Selkirk and Hawick. They often lacked players, with a stronger football presence to the north, due to the links to Midlothian and Edinburgh. With the growth of neighbouring Innerleithen, improving links and players from local schools, PRFC gradually climbed the ranks. David Rupert Wills III scored the fastest try in PRFC history, touching down after only 9 seconds on the 24th of March 2018.

In 1974–75 Peebles joined the National Leagues and were placed in Division 5 East. Promotion to Division 3 came in 1989–90. The big jump came in 2001–02 to Division 2 and then to Division 1 in 2002–03. After two seasons in Division 1, there followed two successive drops to Premier 3 before gaining promotion back to Scottish Hydro Electric Premier 2 in 2007–08 where Peebles remained until restructuring of the League system in 2011.

"A jugular foramen is one of the two (left and right) large foramina (openings) in the base of the skull, located behind the carotid canal. It is formed by the temporal bone and the occipital bone. It allows many structures to pass, including the inferior petrosal sinus, three cranial nerves, the sigmoid sinus, and meningeal arteries.

Structure 
The jugular foramen is formed in front by the petrous portion of the temporal bone, and behind by the occipital bone. It is generally slightly larger on the right side than on the left side.

Contents 
The jugular foramen may be subdivided into three compartments, each with their own contents.

 The anterior compartment transmits the inferior petrosal sinus.
 The intermediate compartment transmits the glossopharyngeal nerve, the vagus nerve, and the accessory nerve.
 The posterior compartment transmits the sigmoid sinus (becoming the internal jugular vein), and some meningeal branches from the occipital artery and ascending pharyngeal artery.

An alternative imaging based subclassification exists, delineated by the jugular spine which is a bony ridge partially separating the jugular foramen into two parts:
 The smaller, anteromedial, ""pars nervosa"" compartment contains CN IX, (tympanic nerve, a branch of CN IX), and receives the venous return from inferior petrosal sinus.
 The larger, posterolateral, ""pars vascularis"" compartment contains CN X, CN XI, Arnold's nerve (or the auricular branch of CN X involved in the Arnold's reflex, where external auditory meatus stimulation causes cough), jugular bulb, and posterior meningeal branch of ascending pharyngeal artery.

Clinical significance 
Obstruction of the jugular foramen can result in jugular foramen syndrome.

"Staincross was a Wapentake (Hundred), which is an administrative division (or ancient district), in the historic county of the West Riding of Yorkshire. It consisted of seven parishes, and included the towns of Barnsley and Penistone

History
Staincross was named after the village of Staincross and also included the parishes of Cawthorne, Darton, Felkirk, Hemsworth, High Hoyland, Penistone, Royston, Silkstone (including Barnsley) and Tankersley and parts of Darfield. Of the nine wapentakes in the West Riding of Yorkshire, Staincross typically had the lowest population density, which was recorded in 1867 as 27,089.

The original meeting place of the wapentake is believed to have been in, or near, to the village of Staincross, similar to the wapentakes at Ewcross and Osgoldcross. The name derives from the Old Norse of stein-kross, literally, stone cross.

Originally located in the West Riding of Yorkshire, the majority of area within Staincross Wapentake is now within South Yorkshire, with Hemsworth and surrounding villages today a part of the Wakefield Metropolitan District, within West Yorkshire. The original boundaries nestled against the wapentakes of Agbrigg to the north, Osgoldcross to the east and Strafforth to the south and south east. On the western edge, the wapentake bordered the Hamestan Hundred of Cheshire. It was estimated to have covered an area of , although, according to Domesday records, a smaller portion, geographically removed from the rest of the wapentake, was located at the village of Adlingfleet where the rivers Ouse and Trent converge.

Although some distance from the village of Staincross, the Church of All Saints, Silkstone, was sometimes known as the ""Mother Church"" of the Staincross Wapentake.

Apart from this, his most successful time in international cricket came during the 1994 ICC Trophy in Kenya. His century, scoring 177 not out, against the eventual champions UAE was the only bright point for his team, in what was a miserable campaign for them. Jahangir followed his hundred with 48 against The Netherlands and 57 against Kenya. He finished with 283 runs at an average of 47.16 runs per innings. He was also a member of the Bangladesh team that won the ICC Trophy in 1997. However, he played in only one of the matches (against the hosts Malaysia, in the Group stages).

"The Nancy Reagan defense is a tactic in corporate finance used to counter a takeover or merger bidder who has made a formal bid to shareholders to buy their shares.  When the board of directors of the target company meets to consider the bid, they ""just say no.""

For example, in a discussion of a takeover of the Walt Disney Company by Comcast, analyst Andy Kessler on Wall Street Week stated ""there are two great Wall Street defenses. One is the Nancy Reagan defense and the other is the Pac-Man defense, right? And the Nancy Reagan defense is, just say no.""  An early use of the term referred to NCR's takeover defense against AT&T in 1991.

The term refers to the ""Just Say No"" anti-drug campaign of the early 1980s and repeated by former United States First Lady Nancy Reagan advocating abstinence from recreational drug use.

History

Prior to World War II, Mongnai State (Burmese, Mo-Ne) was one of the largest and the most important of the States in the Eastern subdivision of the Southern Shan States.
The early history of Mong Nai State is buried in obscurity. The town has been several times burnt, as it has always been the centre of disturbances in the Southern Shan States, and all records have perished in the various fires.

The original city, according to Burmese accounts, was founded in the year 24 of Religion (519 BC) by Sao Hkio, who was the first of a line of independent Chiefs. In about 1223 AD, Mong Nai was conquered by Sam Long Hpa of the Northern Shan Empire and became tributary to Se Lan, the old Mong Mi line of Saophas (Sawbwas) was then put in charge of the State.

2002 Massacre

On the night of October 14, 2002 during a religious holiday the Burmese Army shelled the town at 11:00pm leaving 6 men and 64 women dead and another 21 injured.

"Turner Mastin Marquett (July 19, 1831 – December 22, 1894) was a Nebraska Republican politician best known for being the first House representative for the state.

Early life
Marquett (sometimes spelled ""Marquette"") was born near Springfield, Ohio, in 1831 and attended Springfield High School and Wittenberg College. He graduated from Ohio University in 1855 and moved to Plattsmouth, Nebraska in 1856. He studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1859, and practiced in Plattsmouth.

Career
Marquett was a member of the Nebraska Territorial assembly from 1857 to 1859, and in the Territorial council in 1860 and 1861. He ran and won as Delegate from the Territory of Nebraska to the Fortieth United States Congress, but, since Nebraska was accepted as a state in 1867, the election was voided. He ran for the at-large seat as a U.S. representative for the State of Nebraska, but, because of the exact date of admission, he was only able to serve as a representative for two days.

He resumed his practice in Plattsmouth, moving to Lincoln, Nebraska in 1874. He was general attorney for the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad from 1869 until December 22, 1894, when he died in Tampa, Florida.  He was buried at Wyuka Cemetery in Lincoln.

"Chicken Soup with Barley is a 1956 play by British playwright Arnold Wesker. It is the first of the 'Wesker trilogy' – being followed by Roots and I'm Talking About Jerusalem – and was first performed on stage in 1958 at the Belgrade Theatre in Coventry, transferring later that year to the Royal Court Theatre in London. It is considered to be an important play in the history of post-war British theatre, and one of the few English plays with a sympathetic portrayal of a communist family.

The play is split into three acts, each with two scenes. It spans 20 years of the lives of the Jewish, immigrant Kahn family living in 1936 in London, and traces the downfall of their ideals in a changing world, parallel to the disintegration of the family. The protagonists are the parents, Sarah and Harry, and their children, Ada and Ronnie. They are communists, and Wesker explores how they struggle to maintain their convictions in the face of the Second World War, Stalinism, and the 1956 Hungarian Revolution. Sarah is an adamant socialist; she is strong, family-minded, honest though bossy; Harry, her husband, is weak, a liar and lacks conviction; Ada is extremely passionate about what she believes in, especially Marxism, and, like the others, is also romantic both personally and politically; and finally, Ronnie is a romantic, youthful idealist.

The character of Sarah was based on Arnold Wesker's aunt, Sarah Wesker, who was a trade union activist in the East End of London.

A major revival, starring Samantha Spiro, was staged at the Royal Court in the summer of 2011.

"Alexander Aetolus (, Ἀléxandros ὁ Aἰtōlós) was a Greek poet and grammarian, the only known representative of Aetolian poetry.

Life
Alexander was the son of Satyrus (Σάτυρος) and Stratocleia (Στρατόκλεια), and was a native of Pleuron in Aetolia, although he spent the greater part of his life at Alexandria, where he was reckoned one of the seven tragic poets who constituted the Tragic Pleiad. 
  
Alexander flourished about 280 BC, in the reign of Ptolemy II Philadelphus. He had an office in the Library of Alexandria, and was commissioned by Ptolemy to make a collection of all the tragedies and satyric dramas that were extant. He spent some time, together with Antagoras and Aratus, at the court of Antigonus II Gonatas.

Notwithstanding the distinction Alexander enjoyed as a tragic poet, he appears to have had greater merit as a writer of epic poems, elegies, epigrams, and cynaedi.  Among his epic poems, we possess the titles and some fragments of three pieces: the Fisherman, Kirka or Krika, which, however, is designated by Athenaeus as doubtful, and Helena,  Of his elegies, some beautiful fragments are still extant.<ref>Scholiast and Eustathius, ad Il. iii. 314</ref>  His Cynaedi, or Ionic poems'' (), are mentioned by Strabo and Athenaeus.  Some anapaestic verses in praise of Euripides are preserved in Gellius.

"Ancyra is a small genus of planthoppers of the family Eurybrachidae and the only genus in the tribe Ancyrini. Species in this genus occur in southeast Asia.

Description
Members of the genus are well known for having a pair of prolonged filaments at the tips of the forewings that arise near a pair of small glossy spots; this creates the impression of a pair of antennae, with corresponding ""eyes"" (a remarkable case of automimicry). The ""false head"" effect is further reinforced by the bugs' habit of walking backwards when it detects movement nearby, so as to misdirect predators to strike at its rear, rather than at its actual head.

Taxonomy
The genus Ancyra was first named in 1845 by Scottish zoologist Adam White. It is the only genus of the tribe Ancyrini (subfamily Platybrachinae, family Eurybrachidae). The type species is Ancyra appendiculata, the species name meaning bearing appendages.

Species

Ancyra annamensis  – Vietnam

"The Dhruva reactor is India's largest nuclear research reactor. It was the first nuclear reactor in Asia proper. Located in the Mumbai suburb of Trombay at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), it is India's primary generator of weapons-grade plutonium-bearing spent fuel for its nuclear weapons program. Originally named the R-5, this open pool reactor first went critical on 8 August 1985 after 10 years of construction. However, the unit did not attain full power until 1988. The reactor experienced at least one serious accident when  of heavy water overflowed from the reactor core in 1985 following vibration problems.

Designed as a larger version of the CIRUS reactor, Dhruva was an Indian designed project built to provide an independent source of weapons-grade plutonium free from safeguards. The Dhruva project cost 950 million rupees. The reactor uses heavy water (deuterium) as a moderator and coolant. Aluminum clad fuel rods containing natural uranium are used to obtain a maximum thermal power output of 100 megawatts. The reactor can produce  of weapons-grade plutonium per year. 

Dhruva, in Indian mythology, is a prince blessed to eternal existence and glory as the Pole Star by Vishnu. It can also mean 'immovable' in Sanskrit.

"Andronicoos of Rhodes (; ; ) was a Greek philosopher from Rhodes who was also the scholarch (head) of the Peripatetic school. He is most famous for publishing a new edition of the works of Aristotle that forms the basis of the texts that survive today.

Life
Little is known about Andronicus' life. He is reported to have been the eleventh scholarch of the Peripatetic school. He taught in Rome, about 58 BC, and was the teacher of Boethus of Sidon, with whom Strabo studied.

Works of Aristotle
Andronicus is of special interest in the history of philosophy, from the statement of Plutarch, that he published a new edition of the works of Aristotle and Theophrastus, which formerly belonged to the library of Apellicon, and were brought to Rome by Sulla with the rest of Apellicon's library in 84. Tyrannion commenced this task, but apparently did not do much towards it. The arrangement which Andronicus made of Aristotle's writings seems to be the one which forms the basis of our present editions and we are probably indebted to him for the preservation of a large number of Aristotle's works.

Writings
Andronicus wrote a work upon Aristotle, the fifth book of which contained a complete list of the philosopher's writings, and he also wrote commentaries upon the Physics, Ethics, and Categories.  None of these works is extant.  Two treatises are sometimes erroneously attributed to him, one On Emotions, the other a commentary on Aristotle's Ethics (really by Constantine Paleocappa in the 16th century, or by John Callistus of Thessalonica).

"Cayenne – Félix Éboué Airport (, ) is French Guiana's main international airport. It is located near the commune of Matoury,  southwest of French Guiana's capital city of Cayenne. It is managed by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of French Guiana (CCI Guyane).

Air Guyane Express has its headquarters on the airport property.

History 
The first airfield at Cayenne, called ""Gallion,"" was built in 1943 in ten months by the U.S. Army Air Corps as a base allowing bombers to reach Africa. Though quickly abandoned upon the completion of the new airport, it can still be found very close to the aerodrome.

The new airport was first given the name ""Rochambeau"" in reference to Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau, commander-in-chief of the French troops in the American Revolutionary War. It was purchased by France in 1949.

This name was controversial because the airport's namesake's son, Donatien-Marie-Joseph de Vimeur, vicomte de Rochambeau, harshly repressed the Haitian Revolution during the Saint-Domingue expedition. Christiane Taubira, then-Member of the National Assembly of France for Guiana, requested in 1999 that the name be changed. Multiple proposals were submitted, including Cépérou, a seventeenth-century indigenous chief. It was finally renamed Félix Éboué Airport in 2012, the change becoming official in January of that year. The code for the airport remains CAY.

Félix Eboué Airport serves approximately 400,000 passengers per year.

Facilities
The airport has an elevation of  above mean sea level. It has one paved runway. It is open to public air traffic and international air traffic.

"Charles Frédéric Dubois (28 May 1804 – 12 November 1867) was a Belgian naturalist.

He was the author of Planches colorées des oiseaux de l’Europe (""Color plates of the birds of Europe"") and Catalogue systématique des Lépidoptères de la Belgique (""Systematic catalog of the Lepidoptera of Belgium""), which was completed by his son, Alphonse Joseph Charles Dubois (1839–1921), after his death.

The following quote has been widely attributed to Charles Dubois, as on the Favorite Quotes blog: ""The important thing is this:  to be able at any moment to sacrifice what we are for what we could become."" However, its correct attribution appears to be to Charles Du Bos (1882-1939), the French critic of French and English literature.

The quote comes from his book Approximations (1922): ""...premier tressaillement vital; surtout il s'agit à tout moment de sacrifier ce que nous sommes à ce que nous pouvons devenir.""

Dubois is commemorated in the scientific name of a species of venomous sea snake, Aipysurus duboisii.

"Hesperaloe (false yucca) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asparagaceae, subfamily Agavoideae.  It contains perennial yucca-like plants with long, narrow leaves produced in a basal rosette and flowers borne on long panicles or racemes.  The species are native to the arid parts of Texas in the United States and Mexico and are sometimes cultivated as xerophytic ornamental plants. The ancient Greek drama was a theatrical culture that flourished in ancient Greece from c. 700 BC.  The city-state of Athens, which became a significant cultural, political, and military power during this period, was its center, where it was institutionalised as part of a festival called the Dionysia, which honoured the god Dionysus.  Tragedy (late 500 BC), comedy (490 BC), and the satyr play were the three dramatic genres to emerge there.  Athens exported the festival to its numerous colonies and allies in order to promote a common cultural identity. Helen (Ancient Greek: Ἑλένη , ""Helenē"") is a drama by Euripides about Helen, first produced in 412 BC for the Dionysia in a trilogy that also contained Euripides' lost ""Andromeda"".  The play has much in common with ""Iphigenia in Tauris"", one of the playwright's later works. Dionysia is a genus containing 49 species of flowering plants in the family Primulaceae.

The Naurzum Nature Reserve is a protected area located in the river basin.

Course
The river originates at the confluence of the Zhaldama and Kara-Turgai rivers, which have their sources in the Kazakh Uplands. It  then flows along the Turgay Depression. The Turgay disappears in the endorheic basin of Shalkarteniz.

The Ubagan, a tributary of the Tobol, drains the valley to the north, the Turgay to the south. There are many shallow, often salty lakes in the valley. In the summer it dries up and its water becomes salty in the lower reaches of certain sections. The river is mostly fed by snow. It freezes in November and thaws in April.

Tributaries
The main tributaries of the Turgay are the  long Irgiz, the  long Kara-Turgay and the Kobarga on the left, as well as the Zhaldama, Tokanay and Ulkayak on the right. In years of high water the  long Saryozen river may flow across lake Sarykopa into the Turgay through a channel near Tauysh village.

"The Booch method is a method for object-oriented software development.  It is composed of an object modeling language, an iterative object-oriented development process, and a set of recommended practices.

The method was authored by Grady Booch when he was working for Rational Software (acquired by IBM), published in 1992 and revised in 1994.  It was widely used in software engineering for object-oriented analysis and design and benefited from ample documentation and support tools.

The notation aspect of the Booch methodology was superseded by the Unified Modeling Language (UML), which features graphical elements from the Booch method along with elements from the object-modeling technique (OMT) and object-oriented software engineering (OOSE).  Methodological aspects of the Booch method have been incorporated into several methodologies and processes, the primary such methodology being the Rational Unified Process (RUP).

Content of the method

The Booch notation is characterized by cloud shapes to represent classes and distinguishes the following diagrams:

 
The process is organized around a macro and a micro process.

The macro process identifies the following activities cycle: 
 Conceptualization : establish core requirements
 Analysis : develop a model of the desired behavior
 Design : create an architecture 
 Evolution: for the implementation
 Maintenance : for evolution after the delivery

The micro process is applied to new classes, structures or behaviors that emerge during the macro process.  It is made of the following cycle: 
 Identification of classes and objects
 Identification of their semantics 
 Identification of their relationships
 Specification of their interfaces and implementation

"Shortia is a small genus of subshrubs or perennial herbs in the family Diapensiaceae.  There are five species, four in Asia and one in the Appalachian Mountains of eastern North America.  They are found in mountainous areas, generally from 1000 – elevation.  All have restricted ranges and are generally considered rare.  Three of the species, ""S. galacifolia"", ""S. soldanelloides"", and ""S. uniflora"" are often cultivated.  The genus was by Asa Gray named after botanist Charles Wilkins Short.  In Gray's diary entry for April 8, 1839, he named the genus after Charles Wilkins Short because the plant was native to America in a region close to where Short lived, which was Kentucky.

"The Balfour Declaration of 1926, issued by the 1926 Imperial Conference of British Empire leaders in London, was named after Arthur Balfour, who was Lord President of the Council. It declared the United Kingdom and the Dominions to be:

The Inter-Imperial Relations Committee, chaired by Balfour, drew up the document preparatory to its unanimous approval by the imperial prime ministers on 15 November 1926. It was first proposed by South African Prime Minister J. B. M. Hertzog and Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King.

The declaration accepted the growing political and diplomatic independence of the Dominions in the years after World War I. It also recommended that the governors-general, the representatives of the King in each dominion, should no longer also serve automatically as the representative of the British government in diplomatic relations between the countries. In following years, high commissioners were gradually appointed, whose duties were soon recognised to be virtually identical to those of an ambassador. The first such British high commissioner was appointed to Canada in 1928.

The conclusions of the Imperial Conference of 1926 were re-stated by the 1930 conference and incorporated in the Statute of Westminster of December 1931. In the statute, the British Parliament provided that it would not enact a law which applied to a Dominion as part of the law of that Dominion, unless the law expressly stated that the Dominion government had requested and consented to the enactment of that law.

"The Battle of Westbroek was a battle that occurred on 26 December 1481 between the armies of the prince-bishopric of Utrecht and the county of Holland. It was one of the last battles of the Hook and Cod wars. 

That war had already been won by the Cods and their Burgundian allies. In Utrecht, however, the Hooks revolted and seized the bishop, David of Burgundy at the outbreak of the Second Utrecht Civil War. Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I then won the bishop's freedom.

On 26 December 1481, Bishop David sent an army of 4,000 to 5,000 men to retake Utrecht. When his forces reached the village of Westbroek on the northern edge of Utrecht, they burned the village to the ground and killed the inhabitants. An armed mob formed in Utrecht and headed toward Westbroek to take revenge. When the mob saw the size of David's army, it tried to flee back to the city. Bishop David's army pursued them and killed everybody they could. Sources vary widely on the number of deaths, from 50 prisoners and 100 dead to 500 dead to 1,500 dead.

"Pandanaceae is a family of flowering plants native to the tropics and subtropics of the Old World, from West Africa through the Pacific. It contains 982 known species in five genera, of which the type genus, Pandanus, is the most important, with species like Pandanus amaryllifolius and karuka (Pandanus julianettii) being important sources of food. The family likely originated during the Late Cretaceous.

Characteristics
Pandanaceae includes trees, shrubs, lianas, vines, epiphytes, and perennial herbs. Stems may be simple or bifurcately branched, and may have aerial prop roots. The stems bear prominent leaf scars. The leaves are very long and narrow, sheathing, simple, undivided, with parallel veins; the leaf margins and abaxial midribs are often prickly.

The plants are dioecious. The inflorescences are terminally borne racemes, spikes or umbels, with subtended spathes, which may be brightly colored. The flowers are minute and lack perianths. Male flowers contain numerous stamens with free or fused filaments. Female flowers have a superior ovary, usually of many carpels in a ring, but may be reduced to a row of carpels or a single carpel. Fruits are berries or drupes, usually multiple.

Pandanaceae includes five genera: Benstonea, Freycinetia, Martellidendron, Pandanus, and Sararanga. Benstonea (as subgenus ""Acrostigma"") and Martellidendron were formerly considered subgenera of Pandanus, but were recognized as distinct genera based on DNA sequencing.

Uses
Particular species of Pandanus are used to make mats (e.g. Central Africa) or in food products (e.g. leaves as flavoring, or fruit in Southeast Asia).

"The Stop the War Committee was an anti-war organisation that opposed the Second Boer War. It was formed by William Thomas Stead in 1899. Its president was John Clifford and prominent members included Lloyd George and Keir Hardie. The group was generally seen as pro-Boer.

Against the background of political campaigning for the khaki election of 1900, Stop-The-War distributed millions of posters, cartoons and broadsheets, handing out leaflets to commuters on trains.

Its resolutions were religiously-inspired and utopian in their approach. The Committee united various Nonconformists who held different views in relation to socialism. However, the high moral tone of its pronouncements failed to achieve support from the working class, and provoked stronger antagonism than the more rational approach of the South African Conciliation Committee.

"The Eclipse Comet of 1948, formally known as C/1948 V1, was an especially bright comet discovered during a solar eclipse on November 1, 1948.  Although there have been several comets that have been seen during solar eclipses, the Eclipse Comet of 1948 is perhaps the best-known; it was however, best viewed only from the Southern Hemisphere.

When it was first discovered during totality, it was already quite bright, at magnitude -2; as it was near perihelion, this was its peak brightness.  Its visibility  during morning twilight improved as it receded outward from the Sun; it peaked near zero magnitude, and at one point displayed a tail roughly 30 degrees in length, before falling below naked eye visibility by the end of December.

"Alypius of Antioch was a geographer and a vicarius of Roman Britain, probably in the late 350s AD. He replaced Flavius Martinus after that vicarius' suicide. His rule is recorded is Ammianus XXIII 1, 3.

Life
He came from Antioch and served under Constantius II and was probably appointed to ensure that nobody with western associations was serving in Britain during a time of mistrust, rebellion and suppression symbolised by the brutal acts of the imperial notary Paulus Catena. He may have had to deal with the insurrection of the usurper named Carausius II.

Alypius was afterwards commissioned to rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem as part of Julian's systematic attempt to reverse the Christianization of the Roman Empire by restoring pagan and, in this case, Jewish practices. Among the letters of Julian are two (29 and 30) addressed to Alypius; one inviting him to Rome, the other thanking him for a geographical treatise, which no longer exists.

"Meriç is a town in Edirne Province, Turkey. It is the seat of Meriç District. Its population is 2,820 (2022). The mayor is Erol Dübek (CHP).

History
The land was conquered by the  Ottomans in 1361. Until the Balkan Wars in 1912, a part of the district was part of Soufli (back then still part of the Ottoman Empire), with the other part being connected to the neighbouring district Uzunköprü. After Soufli was lost to Greece in 1913, a new district was formed with the name Kavaklı. From 1920 to 1922, the area was annexed by Greece. Until 1930, the name stayed the same. In 1930, the district got its current name Meriç.

Name
Kavaklı (1913-1930) 
Meriç (1930-present)

The name Meriç comes from the river of Meriç, a river forming the border between present day Turkey and Greece.

"The Tournament is a Canadian television series, which aired on CBC Television in 2005 and 2006. The series, a mockumentary show about a community minor hockey team, depicted the behind-the-scenes interactions between the players, their parents and coaches as the team competed for a spot in the annual youth hockey championship tournament.

The cast included Alain Goulem, Paula Boudreau, Christian Potenza, Emily Tilson, Ari Cohen and Cas Anvar.

Seven episodes were produced in the 2004–05 television season, airing in the winter of 2005, and ten episodes were produced in the 2005–06 season. The CBC announced on February 13, 2006, that the show would not be brought back for the 2006–07 television season. The series was briefly televised in the United States on OLN, which had the rights to the National Hockey League at the time.

Reception
The Serious Comedy Site said ""The Tournament: The Complete Series is an absolute must for anyone who has ever been involved in amateur hockey. For those who like comparisons it is the Bad News Bears meets Slap Shot.""

The TV show was remade in the UK as The Cup, and adapted to be about a junior soccer team instead of a minor hockey team.

"Wahidi ( ) was a sultanate in South Arabia, now part of Yemen. It lay along the Gulf of Aden and bordered Bayḥān to the north, the Upper and Lower ʿAwlaqī sultanates to the west and the Quʿayṭī sultanate in the east. Its main cities were Mayfaʿa, the administrative centre; ʿAzzān, the seat of the ruling dynasty; Ḥabbān, the commercial centre; Qanā; Biʾr ʿAlī; and al-Ḥawṭa.

Wahidi was supposedly founded by a certain ʿAbd al-Wāḥid. He is usually dated to the early 19th century, but Bal-Faqīh al-Shiḥrī puts him about two centuries earlier. His tomb was said to lie in the mosque of Ḥabbān. The sultanate split in the 1880s, with the Wahidi rulers of Biʾr ʿAlī and Balḥāf becoming independent of the ruler of ʿAzzān and Ḥabbān. By 1888–1890, when the British signed treaties of protection with the rulers of the area, incorporating it into the Aden Protectorate, there were four states, their rulers known to the British by different titles: the ruler of Biʾr ʿAlī was a sultan, that of Balḥāf a tribal chief and those of Ḥawra and ʿIrqa shaykhs.

"For interest rate swaps, the Swap rate is the fixed rate that the swap ""receiver"" demands in exchange for the uncertainty of having to pay a short-term (floating) rate, e.g. 3 months LIBOR over time. (At any given time, the market's forecast of what LIBOR will be in the future is reflected in the forward LIBOR curve.) Analogous to YTM for bonds, the swap rate is then the market's quoted price for entering the swap in question.

At the time of the swap agreement, the total value of the swap's fixed rate flows will be equal to the value of expected floating rate payments implied by the forward LIBOR curve; see Swap (finance)#Valuation.
As forward expectations for LIBOR change, so will the fixed rate that investors demand to enter into new swaps. 
Swaps are typically quoted in this fixed rate, or alternatively in the “swap spread,” which is the difference between the swap rate and the U.S. Treasury bond yield (or equivalent local government bond yield for non-U.S. swaps) for the same maturity.

In most emerging markets with underdeveloped government bond markets, the swap curve is more complete than the treasury yield curve, and is thus used as the benchmark curve.

"Belgian hip hop music has a few rappers stemming from Africa and Italy. Belgium, like France, controlled African countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire), Rwanda, and Burundi until the early 1960s. Like in France, immigrants from these countries started to study and live in Belgium.

The Belgian hip hop scene started in the late 1980s with a U.S.-based techno/hip hop group called Technotronic. In the group was an emcee named Ya Kid K from the Democratic Republic of the Congo who later led the group into international fame with hits like ""Pump up the Jam"" and ""Shake That Body"". In 1990, she also joined the group Hi-Tek 3 who were heard on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack.

However, the first major pop rapper from Belgium was Benny B, who had a very mainstream and commercial sound.  According to the European Music Office's report on Music in Europe, this was the first of many pop acts that helped inspire a backlash and the creation of an underground hip hop scene.

Also in the late 1980s in the Walloon south of the country, French speaking/rapping Starflam was the biggest name in hip hop. In the Flemish north Dutch speaking/rapping groups like 't Hof van Commerce, Krapoel In Axe, St Andries MC's, and ABN were popular, rapping in their regional dialects.

Today, the Belgian hip hop scene is growing. Rappers like Coely, Roméo Elvis and Damso are achieving commercial success in their country and abroad. Other contemporary rappers/formations are Stikstof, Woodie Smalls, L'Or Du Commun and Isha.

"Bar Kokhba is a double album by John Zorn, recorded between 1994 and 1996. It features music from Zorn's Masada project, rearranged for small ensembles. It also features the original soundtrack from The Art of Remembrance – Simon Wiesenthal, a film by Hannah Heer and Werner Schmiedel (1994–95).

Reception 
The AllMusic review by Marc Gilman noted: ""While some compositions retain their original structure and sound, some are expanded and probed by Zorn's arrangements, and resemble avant-garde classical music more than jazz. But this is the beauty of the album; the ensembles provide a forum for Zorn to expand his compositions. The album consistently impresses.""

"Andrew Startin is an Australian performer, impersonator and television personality.

Startin came to prominence in 1997 as a result of a video tape of him impersonating Sam Newman being sent into The AFL Footy Show in an attempt to win a trip to London. He won, and the incredible accuracy of his voice, expressions and mannerisms shot him to fame as he appeared four more times that year on The Footy Show, including one episode where he filled in for Sam Newman, after the controversial personality broke his leg.

In 1998, Startin split from Channel Nine amid much publicity. He was to join Channel Seven, and new football/variety show to rival Nine's The Footy Show. Live And Kicking provided guest appearances for Startin.

Startin has a vast repertoire of impersonations. They include football identities such as Bruce McAvaney, Dennis Cometti, Mike Sheahan, Gary Ayres and Leigh Matthews; as well as media personalities such as Molly Meldrum, Rove McManus and Roy Slaven.

After the demise of Live And Kicking, Startin has performed at corporate functions and made guest appearances at public interest functions such as the Grand Final Breakfast. He has been a guest on Channel Ten's The Panel and was a member of the cast on Russell Coight's Celebrity Challenge, also on Channel Ten. In 2005 he appeared on The Footy Show weekly as part of a parody of Seven's show Talking Footy. His most famous impersonation was of Gary Ayres, using such phrases as ""At the end of the day"".

He is an optician and human rights-activist, and claims to have founded Algeria's first independent human rights association. In 1983-84 and again in 1985–87, he was imprisoned by the Algerian government for endangering the security of the state and forming an illegal association.

Rebaine founded Ahd 54 (named after the start of the Algerian War of Independence in 1954) and became its first secretary-general in 1991. He was re-elected in 1998, although the party has had little impact on Algerian politics. Rebaine ran again as its candidate in the Algerian presidential election of 2004, but ended up with only 0,6% of the vote.

It was formerly a public house, known as the White Hart because King Richard II's wife, Isabella of Valois was kept prisoner at the Bishop's Palace in the village after his death and his badge was a White Hart. In 1989, the original White Hart was combined with The Red House, previously a private home on Lee's Hill where the dramatist Sir Terence Rattigan resided during 1945–47, to become The Great House.

About 150 metres East on the opposite side of the B478 road are Deanery Garden and St Andrew's Church. Close by, just over Sonning Bridge, is The Mill at Sonning, now a dinner theatre. On the opposite Oxfordshire bank of the Thames is another riverside hotel and restaurant, the French Horn.

Patrons have included Amal and George Clooney. The Clooneys bought the nearby Mill House in Sonning Eye in 2014.

A new, permanent exhibition located in the foyer of JBT, which opened to the public on 16 May 2018, pays tribute to the life and legacy of Jamshed Bhabha. In 2016, the theatre hosted the first public shows of Mughal-e-Azam, a Broadway-style musical directed by Feroz Abbas Khan and jointly produced by Shapoorji Pallonji Group and the National Centre for the Performing Arts (India). The musical is based on the 1960 Bollywood film Mughal-e-Azam, directed by K. Asif and produced by Shapoorji Pallonji. In 2019, the theatre produced and premiered the Agatha Christie whodunnit classic, The Mirror Crack'd directed by Melly Still, produced by Pádraig Cusack, in a new version for an Indian audience by Ayeesha Menon, based on the adaptation by Rachel Wagstaff of the novel The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side, and starring Sonali Kulkarni, Denzil Smith and Shernaz Patel.

"Glass cloth is a textile material woven from glass fiber yarn.

Home and garden
Glass cloth was originally developed to be used in greenhouse paneling, allowing sunlight's ultraviolet rays to be filtered out, while still allowing visible light through to plants.

Glass cloth is also a term for a type of tea towel suited for polishing glass. The cloth is usually woven with the plain weave, and may be patterned in various ways, though checked cloths are the most common. The original cloth was made from linen, but a large quantity is made with cotton warp and tow weft, and in some cases they are composed entirely of cotton. Short fibres of the cheaper kind are easily detached from the cloth.

In the Southern Plains during the Dust Bowl, states' health officials recommended attaching translucent glass cloth to the inside frames of windows to help in keeping the dust out of buildings, although people also used paperboard, canvas or blankets. Eyewitness accounts indicate they were not completely successful.

Use in technology
Due to properties of glass such as heat resistance and an inability to ignite, glass has been used to create fire barriers in hazardous environments such as inside of racecars. Its poor flexibility, and its being a source of skin irritation, made the fibers inadequate for apparel uses.

Its bi-directional strength make glass cloth useful for some fiberglass reinforced plastics. For example, the Rutan VariEze homebuilt aircraft uses a moldless glass cloth - epoxy composite structure and skin. Glass cloth is commonly used as the reinforcing lattice for pre-pregs.

"radio SHARK (the capitalization is a trademarked logotype) is a computer-controlled radio designed by Griffin Technology, introduced in late 2004. A second generation (radio SHARK 2) superseded it in 2007; they are distinguishable by color (the first model is white, the second is black). The radio connects the computer through a USB interface, which also supplies power to the radio.  The device is shaped like a shark fin, which includes four internal LED lights attached to three pieces of clear plastic on each side of the device's case, two LEDs of which glow blue when plugged in, the other two of which glow red when recording radio.

Software designed for radio SHARK allows users to record radio programs at specific times and frequencies. The software also facilitates listening of ""live"" radio using time-shifting technology. Using the time-shifting features of the software, users can pause, rewind, and fast-forward ""live"" radio, in a manner similar to how users of TiVo or other digital video recorders can time-shift video. The radio SHARK uses the computer's hard drive to store audio files that allow for the time-shifting functionality. 

The radio SHARK tunes in (Standard mode) 87.5 through 108.0 MHz FM, (Japanese mode) 76.0 through 90.0 MHz FM, and 522 through 1710 kHz AM. radio SHARK can tune both odd and even increments of FM frequencies, and either 9 or 10 kHz increments on AM.  

Currently, radio SHARK is compatible with both Macintosh and Microsoft Windows. The Macintosh version of the radio SHARK software can load recorded audio files directly into iTunes, facilitating easy transfer of recorded radio programs to an iPod or CD. The product has now been discontinued by the manufacturer, who also says, ""We do not support the use of this product in Lion, Mac OS 10.7 and later.""

"Astronomer royal is a senior post in the Royal Households of the United Kingdom. There are two officers, the senior being the astronomer royal dating from 22 June 1675; the junior is the astronomer royal for Scotland dating from 1834.

The post was created by King Charles II in 1675, at the same time as he founded the Royal Observatory, Greenwich. He appointed John Flamsteed, instructing him "".""

The astronomer royal was director of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich from the establishment of the post in 1675 until 1972. The astronomer royal became an honorary title in 1972 without executive responsibilities, and a separate post of director of the Royal Greenwich Observatory was created to manage the institution.

The astronomer royal today receives a stipend of 100 GBP per year and is a member of the royal household, under the general authority of the Lord Chamberlain. After the separation of the two offices, the position of astronomer royal has been largely honorary, although the holder remains available to advise the Sovereign on astronomical and related scientific matters, and the office is of great prestige.

There was formerly a royal astronomer of Ireland, a post that seemingly ended with Irish independence.

The astronomer royal is mentioned in H. G. Wells' novel The War of the Worlds and in George Orwell's Down and Out in Paris and London. He also makes an appearance in the lyrics of Gilbert and Sullivan'''s The Pirates of Penzance and plays an important role in Fred Hoyle's novel The Black Cloud''.

"Holando-Argentino is a breed of cattle primarily found in Argentina, and derived from Holstein-Friesian Cattle. It was first introduced from the Netherlands in 1880, to the fertile regions of the Pampas, and devoted to the production of both beef and milk.

Holando-Argentino cattle can be now found in the Argentine provinces of Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, Córdoba and Entre Ríos, as well as in small river basins in Salta, Tucumán, Formosa, Catamarca and Mendoza. They have also been exported to neighbouring countries. They are now primarily kept for milk production.

The cows are medium-sized, standing 1.4 to 1.5 metres tall and weighing 600 to 650 kg. Good legs and feet allow extensive foraging.

Promotion of this breed and technical resources to manage it are the goals of the Asociación Criadores de Holando-Argentino (ACHA, Holando-Argentino Breeders Association), founded in 1944.

"""Carbona Not Glue"" is a song by the Ramones from their second album, Leave Home (1977).

Story
""Carbona Not Glue"" is a follow-up to ""Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue"", a song that appeared on their first album. The band sarcastically suggested that the high obtained from sniffing Carbona cleaning solvent (carbon tetrachloride) was more pleasurable than that of airplane glue. In the hardcover book included in some versions of Hey! Ho! Let's Go: The Anthology, Tommy Ramone says, ""Something like 'Carbona Not Glue' has to be tongue-in-cheek. It's absurd, like saying that you should try something more poisonous."" It was featured prominently in the graphic novel Ghost World by Dan Clowes.

Controversy
The original release of Leave Home included ""Carbona Not Glue"" as the fifth track on the album. However, the song was deleted from the album to avoid a potential lawsuit, as Carbona was a corporate trademark. The album was re-released with the outtake ""Babysitter"", which was also released as the B-side of ""Do You Wanna Dance?"", in its place. On the British version, ""Babysitter"" is not listed on the back cover or inner sleeve, but it is listed on the label. Most collectors believe that the ""Babysitter"" version is rarer than the ""Carbona"" version.

When Sire Records suddenly switched distributors from ABC Records to Warner Bros. Records (who had bought the label), yet another version of the album was released, with ""Babysitter"" being replaced by ""Sheena Is a Punk Rocker"", then a non-LP single already planned to be on the next Ramones album in a different mix.

""Carbona Not Glue"" was restored to its original position in the running order for the 2001 expanded edition of Leave Home, and the deluxe 40th anniversary edition included additional mixes of the track.

"Abatement of debts and legacies is a common law doctrine of wills that holds that when the equitable assets of a deceased person are not sufficient to satisfy fully all the creditors, their debts must abate proportionately, and they must accept a dividend.

Also, in the case of legacies when the funds or assets out of which they are payable are not sufficient to pay them in full, the legacies abate in proportion, unless there is a priority given specially to any particular legacy. Annuities are also subject to the same rule as general legacies.

The order of abatement is usually:
 Intestate property
 The residuary of the estate
 General Devises—i.e., cash gifts
 Demonstrative Devises—i.e., cash gifts from a specific account, stocks, bonds, securities, etc.
 Specific Devises—i.e., specified items of personal property, real property, etc.
Non-probate property—i.e., life insurance policies—do not abate.

Definitions
A specific devise, is a specific gift in a will to a specific person other than an amount of money. For example, if James's will states that he is leaving his $500,000 yacht to his brother Mike, the yacht would be a specific devise.

A general devise, is a monetary gift to a specific person to be satisfied out of the overall estate. For example, if James's will states that he is leaving $500,000 to his son Sam then the money would be a general devise.

A demonstrative devise, is money given from a particular account. For example, ""$10,000 to be paid from the sale of my GM stock.""

A residual devise is one left to a devisee after all specific and general devices have been made. For example, James's will might say: ""I give all the rest, residue and remainder of my estate to my daughter Lilly."" Lilly would be the residual devisee and entitled to James's residuary estate.

"Yishtabach () (Hebrew: ""[ God ] be praised"") is a prayer in the final portion of the Pesukei Dezimra morning prayers of Judaism known as shacharit, recited before the second kaddish leading to the Shema prayers. 

The theme of the number ""fifteen"" plays a pivotal role in the blessing; there are fifteen expressions conveying praise in the beginning half of the paragraph and fifteen words in the concluding blessing (after ""Blessed are You, God...""). The number fifteen is an allusion both to the Divine Name יה (whose gematria is fifteen) and to the fifteen Songs of Ascents composed by King David (Psalms 120–34).

There are two themes of Yishtabach: God's power and might are deserving of our praise and adoration, and that one must continually praise God.

Since Baruch Sheamar and Yishtabach are both blessings, this gives the sense that Pesukei Dezimra is one single prayer. Yishtabach is not recited unless Baruch Sheamar is recited, because Baruch Sheamar is the opening blessing, and Yishtabach is the closing blessing.

Yishtabach is normally recited while standing. This is because Baruch Sheamar is recited while standing, and since Baruch Sheamar is the opening of Pesukei Dezimra and Yishtabach is the conclusion, they are both recited in the same manner. However, on Shabbat, some congregations have a custom to sit.

The author of Yishtabach is not known to this day. But with words 2–5 in the prayer spelling שׁלמה (Shlomo), this alludes to a reference to King Solomon.

Sebadoh ( ) is an American indie rock band, currently signed with Joyful Noise Recordings.  Sebadoh were formed in 1988 in Northampton, Massachusetts, by Eric Gaffney and Dinosaur Jr bass player Lou Barlow.  Along with such bands as Pavement and Guided by Voices, Sebadoh helped pioneer lo-fi music, a style of indie rock characterized by low-fidelity recording techniques, often on four-track machines.  The band's early output, such as ""The Freed Man"" and ""Weed Forestin'"" (both released 1990), as well as ""Sebadoh III"" (1991), was typical of this style.  After a 14-year recording hiatus, during which time members pursued other projects while occasionally touring as Sebadoh, the group returned in 2013 with the ""Secret EP"" and a full-length album titled ""Defend Yourself"", which were both self-recorded.  Lead singer Lou Barlow says of the band's resurrected sound, ""We kept to ourselves during the recording and didn’t have much, if any, outside intervention.  That, to my mind, makes it a true Sebadoh record and aligns the style of ""Defend Yourself"" with our early releases.""",Answer the following question based on the context: Are CSS and Sebadoh from the same country?,
"The Lake Ontario Shore Railroad (LOSRR) was a short-lived common carrier railroad in New York that was absorbed by the Rome, Watertown and Ogdensburg Railroad.

Construction 
The LOSRR was chartered to be built from Suspension Bridge, New York to Oswego, New York in 1858.  The Lake Ontario Shore Railroad Company was founded in Oswego on March 27, 1868. Under Chief Engineer James Ross, work commenced in August 1871 in Red Creek, New York.  Tracks were open to Oswego, New York in 1873.

Early Death 
Despite heavy support from on-line and planned on-line communities, the LOSRR was unable to handle its great financial obligations.  Reasons include a lack of manufacturing industries, bypassing Rochester, New York and close competition with the New York Central Railroad.  Construction only got as far as Kendall, New York.  On September 22, 1874, the railroad was sold in court under foreclosure to the Rome, Watertown and Ogdensburg Railroad, who reorganized the railroad as the Lake Ontario Railroad Company on September 29.  On October 22, this company and the RW&O made an agreement to consolidate, which was filed with the New York Secretary of State on December 23, 1875.

It belongs to the genre of dramma giocoso and is in one act.  ""Don Giovanni Tenorio"" was first performed at the Teatro San Moisè, Venice, on February 5, 1787.  The libretto, by Giovanni Bertati, is based on the legend of Don Juan as told by Tirso de Molina in his play ""The Trickster of Seville and the Stone Guest"" (c. 1630), leading to comparisons with Mozart's ""Don Giovanni"", which had its premiere later in 1787.  Mozart's librettist, Lorenzo Da Ponte, certainly knew the earlier opera.  Gazzaniga's work is much shorter than Mozart's, however, and originally formed part of a double-bill with another piece, ""Il capriccio drammatico"".

"The Goplans or Goplanes (, ) was an early West Slavic tribe that inhabited the central parts of the Kujawy region, with their probable seat at Kruszwica. They might have been named after the Lake Gopło; Kmietowicz believes the Bavarian Geographer (845) overheard it and recorded it (as Glopeani). Many remnants of small strongholds have been unearthed around the lake. The tribe was absorbed by the Polans in the 10th century.

Bavarian Geographer

The medieval chronicle claims that Glopeani controlled 400 gords (fortified wooden settlements), as if the tribe was dominant in the area; however, the archeological research in Kruszwica has failed to uncover the fortress, although it does indicate the presence of a large settlement. A possible resolution has been offered by Gerard Labuda who hypothesized that the ""Goplanie"" were the same as, or a part of, the Polans, whose main center was located at Gniezno.
 
The chronicle doesn't indicate the location of the tribe; however, it can be inferred from the list of neighboring tribes and their known locations: #14 Osterabtrezi (identified as Eastern Obodrites), #15 Miloxi, #16 Phesnuzi, #17 Thadesi, #18 Glopeani, #19 Zuireani, #20 Busani (identified as Buzhans on the Bug river). The position on the list suggest the Glopeani tribe might have lived in Pomerania, Great Poland or Masovia.

"The Pequod is a fictional 19th-century Nantucket whaling ship that appears in the 1851 novel ""Moby-Dick"" by American author Herman Melville.  The ""Pequod"" and her crew, commanded by Captain Ahab, are central to the story, which, after the initial chapters, takes place almost entirely aboard the ship during a three-year whaling expedition in the Atlantic, Indian and South Pacific oceans.  Most of the characters in the novel are part of the ""Pequod""' s crew, including the narrator Ishmael. Herman Melville (August 1, 1819 – September 28, 1891) was an American novelist, short story writer, and poet of the American Renaissance period.  His best known works include ""Typee"" (1846), a romantic account of his experiences in Polynesian life, and his whaling novel ""Moby-Dick"" (1851).  His work was almost forgotten during his last thirty years.  His writing draws on his experience at sea as a common sailor, exploration of literature and philosophy, and engagement in the contradictions of American society in a period of rapid change.  He developed a complex, baroque style: the vocabulary is rich and original, a strong sense of rhythm infuses the elaborate sentences, the imagery is often mystical or ironic, and the abundance of allusion extends to biblical scripture, myth, philosophy, literature, and the visual arts.",Answer the following question based on the context: When does the author of The Pequod born?,

"The daggertooth pike conger (Muraenesox cinereus) also known as the darkfin pike eel in Australia, to distinguish it from the related pike-eel  (Muraenesox bagio), is a species of eel in the pike conger family, Muraenesocidae. They primarily live on soft bottoms in marine and brackish waters down to a depth of , but may enter freshwater. They commonly grow to about  in length, but may grow as long as . Daggertooth pike congers occur in the Red Sea, on the coast of the northern Indian Ocean, and in the West Pacific from Indochina to Japan. A single specimen was also reported in the Mediterranean Sea off Israel in 1982.

Culinary uses 

Daggertooth pike conger is a major commercial species, with annual catches reaching about 350,000 tonnes in recent years. The spot reporting the largest landings was Taiwan. It is eaten in Japanese cuisine, where it is known as hamo (ハモ, 鱧). In the Kansai Region, hamo no kawa (pickled conger skins) is a traditional delicacy, and pike conger is a common ingredient in some types of kamaboko (fish cake).

Parasites 

As with other fish, the daggertooth pike conger harbours several species of parasites. 

A species of trichosomoidid nematode which parasitizes the muscles of the fish off Japan has been described in 2014 and named Huffmanela hamo, in reference to the Japanese name of the fish. Accumulations of eggs of the parasite are visible as 1–2mm black spots in the flesh of the fish. The parasite is rare and the consumption of infected fish meat has no consequences for humans.

Some of these districts are nationally known, others more locally. Some of them may vary in their delimitations, while others are based on ancient hundreds and syssels with fixed borders. Dialect, folklore and local identity will or would often vary from one traditional district to another.

"The Giant Viper was a trailer-mounted, vehicle-pulled, mine clearance system, designed to be deployed in areas containing land mines. It was developed for the British Army in the 1950s. It was designed to be towed behind a Centurion gun tank, FV4003, AVRE (Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers); and also the FV432 Armoured personnel carrier.

The Giant Viper used rockets to launch a 250-metre-long hose, packed with plastic explosive, across a minefield. In the 1970s, the Giant Viper hoses were filled at ROF Chorley. Once it lands the charge is detonated, clearing a six-metre-wide path of anti-personnel and anti-tank mines by sympathetic detonation. This cleared path has a length of around 200 metres. For safety, a vehicle fitted with a mine plough is driven through the cleared path before any other personnel, in order to push any undetonated mines safely out of the way.

This system has been superseded by the Python Minefield Breaching System, employing the same methodology, but using more modern components. It improves accuracy of delivery, deployment speed, and the size of the cleared path, which is now 230 metres long and 7 meters wide. Python was designed to be towed behind an AVRE.

The Hellenic Army's Engineer Corps still utilize the system.

"Červené Dřevo () is a hamlet in Chudenín in Klatovy District in the Plzeň Region of the Czech Republic.

Geography
Červené Dřevo is located about  southwest of Klatovy, about 1 km east of the border with Germany. It is situated in Fleky part of the municipality of Chudenín.

History
Červené Dřevo (under its German name Rothenbaum) was founded after the Thirty Years' War (mid-17th century). Situated in the historical region of Sudetenland, it was inhabited by Sudeten Germans. The church was founded in 1680. In 1880, the settlement consisted of ten houses.

From the revolution in 1848 until World War I, Červené Dřevo/Rothenbaum was a separate municipality, and included also the nearby village of Fleky. After the war, Fleky became a municipality and Červené Dřevo was attached to it. Following the expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia after World War II, the village was deserted and destroyed, and Czechoslovak border fortifications during the Cold War were installed. The locality then fell under the administration of the municipality of Chudenín.

Sights
The Church of Our Lady of Sorrows used to be in the village. It was burned in 1953 and the ruins were demolished shortly after. In the early 1990s, the expellees erected a memorial in the ruins of the church.

"The Satu Mare Swabians or Sathmar Swabians (German: Sathmarer Schwaben) are a German ethnic group in the Satu Mare () region of Romania. Romanian Germans, they are one of the various Danube Swabian () subgroups that are actually Swabian in heritage, and their dialect, Sathmar Swabian, is similar to the other varieties of the Swabian German dialect.

Most were originally farmers in Upper Swabia who migrated to Partium (at the time Hungary, now Romania) in the 18th century, as part of a widespread eastward movement of German workers and settlers. Their principal settlements were Satu Mare, Carei, Petrești, and Foieni () and they also settled in Urziceni (), Căpleni (), Tiream (), Beltiug (), Ciumești (), and Ardud ().

After World War II, many evacuated, migrated, or were expelled to what became West Germany. Those who remain in Romania, along with other German-speaking groups in this country, are politically represented by the FDGR/DFDR (Democratic Forum of Germans in Romania); in Germany, the Landsmannschaft der Sathmarer Schwaben in Deutschland (Territorial Association of Sathmar Swabians in Germany) represents and assists them. Nowadays, many are more or less magyarized and have become Hungarians.

History 

The Sathmar Swabians' ancestors stem from Upper Swabia () (situated in southern Württemberg area), present-day Germany when the first waves of agricultural colonists arrived in north-western and northern Transylvania during the 18th century, during the end of the Modern Age.

"Serra do Bussaco ( ) is a mountain range in Portugal, formerly included in the province of Beira Litoral. The highest point in the range is the Cruz Alta at 549 m (1801 feet), which has views over the Serra da Estrela, the Mondego River valley and the Atlantic Ocean.

The Serra includes the buildings of a secularized Carmelite monastery, founded in 1628. The convent woods have long been known for their cypress, plane, evergreen oak, cork and other forest trees, many of which have stood for centuries and attained an immense size. A bull of Pope Gregory XV (1623), anathematizing trespassers and forbidding women to approach, is inscribed on a tablet at the main entrance; another bull, of Pope Urban VIII (1643), threatens with excommunication any person harming the trees. Located in the northwestern corner is the Mata Nacional do Bussaco (Bussaco Forest), an ancient walled arboretum.

Towards the close of the 19th century the Serra de Bussaco became one of the regular halting-places for foreign, and especially for British, tourists, on the overland route between Lisbon and Porto. The Palace Hotel of Bussaco (Palácio Hotel do Bussaco), built between 1888 and 1905 in an exuberant Neo-Manueline style, still attracts tourists.

In 1873 a monument was erected, on the southern slopes of the Serra, to commemorate the Battle of Bussaco, in which the French, under Marshal Masséna, were defeated by the Anglo-Portuguese Army, under Lord Wellington, on 27 September 1810.

"An adverbial complement is an adverbial that is required to complete the meaning of a verb, such that if it is removed, it will yield an ungrammatical sentence or an intrinsically different meaning of the verb. They stand in contrast to adverbial adjuncts, which can be removed from a sentence without altering its structure or meaning.

Adverbial complements often accompany verbs of caused motion such as put or place:

She put the cheese back.
*She put the cheese.
Now place the vase on the mantlepiece.
*Now place the vase.

However, they can occur with other types of verbs as well:

We are staying in a hotel.
*We are staying.

Theoretical approaches
Head-driven phrase structure grammar describes adverbial complements as part of the verbs' subcategorization frame, which is why they are obligatory arguments. In this theory, adverbial complements are stored in the lexicon as part of the grammatical competence relating to the verb.

An alternative description, along the lines of construction grammar is that they are parts of certain argument structure constructions – in this case the caused motion construction – which are specifically compatible with the semantics of the verb. Here, adverbial complements are stored in the grammar as part of the caused motion construction which is a sign in its own right.

Another construction-based theory combines the two arguing that certain senses of verbs co-occur so frequently with certain argument structure constructions, that the argument structures are also stored as part of the grammatical competence relating to the verb. These small argument structure constructions are called mini-constructions. So, in the case of put, in accordance with this theory, adverbial complements are both part of the argument structure construction and stored as information regarding the verb itself.

"Eragrostis is a large and widespread genus of plants in the grass family, found in many countries on all inhabited continents and many islands. Sagittaria is a genus of about 30 species of aquatic plants whose members go by a variety of common names, including arrowhead, duck potato, katniss, ""Omodaka"" (沢瀉 in Japanese), swamp potato, tule potato, and wapato (or wapatoo).  Most are native to South, Central, and North America, but there are also some from Europe, Africa, and Asia. Sagittaria platyphylla, the delta arrowhead, broad-leaf arrowhead or delta duck-potato, is a plant species native to the eastern United States.  The core of its range extends from central Texas to the Florida Panhandle north to southern Illinois.  Isolated populations have been reported from Washington State, Missouri, Kansas, Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, eastern Virginia, North and South Carolina and eastern Georgia, Nuevo León, Michoacán and Panamá.  It has also become a noxious weed in Australia.  The plant is an emergent aquatic found in ponds, lakes and slow-moving streams. Eragrostis australasica, commonly known as Swamp Canegrass, is a tussock grass, in the subfamily Chloridoideae of the Poaceae family, that is endemic to Australia.  It is a tufted perennial with strongly branched, cane-like culms, that grows up to 2.4 m in height.  It is typically found on periodically flooded land in arid and semi-arid regions. Eragrostis infecunda , commonly known as Southern Canegrass, is a species of grass, in the subfamily Chloridoideae of the Poaceae family, that is endemic to Australia.

"RTL Radio is a German commercial radio station based in Berlin and the part of the RTL Group. It originated as the German language service of Radio Luxembourg, which began broadcasting after World War II from Luxembourg. It broadcasts adult contemporary music nationally via cable, DAB+ satellite and internet and regionally via FM in Luxembourg, Rheinland-Pfalz, Saarland, eastern German-speaking Belgium, and Lorraine.

History

RTL Radio began broadcasting as the German service of Radio Luxembourg on 15 July 1957. Along with the Saarland-based pirate radio Europe 1, Luxembourg interfered with the non-commercial monopoly imposed by the German states since broadcasting first started in the country. Apart from advertising reaching German radios for the first time, RTL also introduced Germans from both East and West to rock-and-roll, bebop/cool jazz and other types of American popular music which contrasted to the classical repertoire that had dominated mainland services.

In 1990, Radio Luxembourg was renamed RTL Hörfunk. On 1 July 2015 RTL Radio branded itself RTL Radio – Deutschlands Hit-Radio and moved its studios from the City of Luxembourg to Berlin.

RTL Radio has slots on analog and digital cable, and transmits digital signals via the Astra 1L satellites.

"Veronica is the largest genus in the flowering plant family Plantaginaceae, with about 500 species; it was formerly classified in the family Scrophulariaceae.  Common names include speedwell, bird's eye, and gypsyweed. Veronica wormskjoldii is a species of flowering plant in the plantain family known by the common name American alpine speedwell.  It is native to much of northern and western North America, including the western United States and northern Canada, from where it grows in moist alpine habitat, such as mountain forest understory.  It has a wide subarctic distribution from Alaska to Greenland.  This is a rhizomatous perennial herb producing a decumbent to erect, mostly unbranched stem up to 25 to 40 centimeters tall and coated in long hairs.  The oppositely arranged leaves are 2 to 4 centimeters long and lack petioles.  The inflorescence is a hairy, glandular raceme of flowers at the tip of the stem.  Each flower has hairy, lance-shaped sepals and a blue corolla up to a centimeter wide.  The fruit is a capsule around half a centimeter long which contains tiny flattened seeds. Stewartia (sometimes spelled Stuartia) is a genus of 8-20 species of flowering plants in the family Theaceae, related to ""Camellia"".  Most of the species are native to eastern Asia in China, Japan, Korea, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam, with two (""S. malacodendron, S. ovata"") in southeast North America, from Virginia and Kentucky south to Florida and Louisiana. The Antirrhineae are one of the 12 tribes of the Plantaginaceae family.  It contains the toadflax relatives, such as snapdragons.  They are probably most closely related to the turtlehead tribe (Cheloneae) and/or a large and badly resolved core group of their family including plants as diverse as water-starworts (""Callitriche""), foxgloves (""Digitalis""), and speedwell (""Veronica"").

"The mylohyoid line is a bony ridge on the internal surface of the mandible. It runs posterosuperiorly. It is the site of origin of the mylohyoid muscle, the superior pharyngeal constrictor muscle, and the pterygomandibular raphe.

Structure 
The mylohyoid line is a bony ridge on the internal surface of the body of the mandible. The mylohyoid line extends posterosuperiorly. The mylohyoid line continues as the mylohyoid groove on the internal surface of the ramus. 

The mylohyoid muscle originates from the anterior (front) part of the mylohyoid line. Rarely, the mylohyoid muscle may originate partially from other surfaces of the mandible. The posterior (back) part of this line, near the alveolar margin, gives attachment to a small part of the superior pharyngeal constrictor muscle, and to the pterygomandibular raphe.

Function 
The mylohyoid line is the site of attachment of many muscles, including the mylohyoid muscle, and the superior pharyngeal constrictor muscle. It is also the site of attachment of the pterygomandibular raphe.

It includes the suburbs of Alfords Point, Bonnet Bay, Como, Gymea, Illawong, Jannali, Kangaroo Point, Kareela, Kirrawee, Miranda, Oyster Bay, Sylvania, Sylvania Waters, Taren Point and parts of Caringbah and Sutherland.

History

Created in 1971, Miranda had traditionally been a  electorate, being won by  only at landslide elections, two under Neville Wran in 1978 and 1981, and again under Bob Carr in 1999 and 2003. According to ABC psephologist Antony Green, the seat should have been recovered by the Liberals in 2007 but was narrowly retained by Labor. On a margin of 0.8 percent it was the Labor government's most marginal seat. In 2011 the Liberals won government in a landslide, and the seat of Miranda on a very safe 21.0 percent margin, with 39 seats held by the Coalition on smaller margins.

The seat was made vacant following the resignation of Liberal MP Graham Annesley. The 2013 Miranda by-election was conducted on 19 October, Labor's Barry Collier won the seat with a two-party swing of 26 percent in the largest by-election swing in the state's history. He did not stand for re-election at the 2015 NSW State election and the seat was subsequently won by the Liberal Party's Eleni Petinos.

"Agbrigg and Morley was a wapentake of the West Riding of Yorkshire, England. The main purpose of the wapentake was the administration of justice by a local court. At the time of the Domesday survey in 1086, Agbrigg and Morley were separate wapentakes. For example, Methley was in Agbrigg while Rothwell was in Morley. The wapentakes were probably combined by the 13th century when similar administrative reforms occurred elsewhere in England. It was kept in two divisions, which in the mid-nineteenth century again became wapentakes in their own right.

The Agbrigg Division included the parishes of Almondbury, Emley, Kirkburton, Kirkheaton, Normanton, Rothwell, Sandal Magna, Thornhill, Wakefield and Warmfield with Heath and parts of Batley, Dewsbury, Featherstone, Huddersfield and Rochdale.  The Morley Division included Birstall, Bradford, Calverley and parts of Batley, Huddersfield and Dewsbury.

Nationals.

Bathurst is a regional electorate that encompasses the entirety of the local government areas of Bathurst Region, the City of Lithgow, Blayney Shire, Oberon Shire plus the southern part of Mid-Western Regional Council (including Rylstone, Kandos and Ilford).

History
Bathurst was created in 1859, partly replacing Western Boroughs.  Between 1920 and 1927, it absorbed parts of Hartley and Orange and elected three members under proportional representation.  In 1927 Bathurst, Hartley and Orange were recreated as single-member electorates. It was held by the Labor party for 20 years until the Coalition's landslide win in 2011, where the Nationals candidate Paul Toole recorded a swing of 36.7%, the largest in state history. Of particular note was the suburb of Eglinton, where labor support plummeted from 854 of 1,690 (50.5%) to 180 of 1,690 (10.7%) first preference votes; a precipitous decline of 79%.
This trend was somewhat reversed in 2015, with Toole being re-elected by a margin of around 15,000 votes, a majority of almost two-thirds of the vote, but still down from the approximate 20,000 margin from 2011.

"Ballu tundu or ballu sardu is a traditional Sardinian folk dance which is typically danced in a closed or open circle. The dance was described as early as 1805 by Mameli and by La Marmora in 1825. In northern and central Sardinia, the dance is lively and animated with leaps and agile movements and usually accompanied by a choir of three or more singers in the center of the circle. In other areas, the dance is done to launeddas and the shepherd's sulittu but the accordion had also made its appearance by the 19th century.

At least in the past, the manner of holding hands was very important and followed strict rules. Married or engaged couples could hold hands palm to palm with fingers entwined, but a man could not do this with a young girl or another man's wife.

"Toxicodendron pubescens (syn. Rhus pubescens), commonly known as Atlantic poison oak, is an upright shrub that can grow to 1 metre (3 feet) tall. Its leaves are 15 centimetres (6 inches) long, alternate, with three leaflets on each. The leaflets are usually hairy and are variable in size and shape, but most often resemble white oak leaves; they usually turn yellow or orange in autumn. The fruit is small, round, and yellowish or greenish. It is not closely related to true oaks.

Distribution and habitat
This species is native to the Southeastern United States from Virginia westward to Texas and Oklahoma.

Atlantic poison oak can be found growing in forests, thickets, and dry, sandy fields.

Toxicity

All parts of this plant contain urushiol, which can cause severe dermatitis in sensitive individuals. The risk of exposure may be reduced by learning to recognize and avoid this species and wearing clothing that covers the legs and arms. Contaminated clothing should be laundered before subsequent handling or use.

Effects of poison oak are similar to those of poison ivy. It first causes severe itching, evolves into inflammation, non-colored bumps, and then blistering when scratched.

Breiðablik (sometimes anglicised as Breithablik or Breidablik) is the home of Baldr in Nordic mythology.

Meaning
The word  has been variously translated as 'broad sheen', 'Broad gleam', 'Broad-gleaming' or 'the far-shining one',

Attestations

Grímismál
The Eddic poem Grímnismál describes Breiðablik as the fair home of Baldr:

Gylfaginning
In Snorri Sturluson's Gylfaginning, Breiðablik is described in a list of places in heaven, identified by some scholars as Asgard:

Later in the work, when Snorri describes Baldr, he gives another description, citing Grímnismál, though he does not name the poem:

Interpretation and discussion
The name of Breiðablik has been noted to link with Baldr's attributes of light and beauty.

Similarities have been drawn between the description of Breiðablik in Grímnismál and Heorot in Beowulf, which are both free of 'baleful runes' ( and  respectively). In Beowulf, the lack of  refers to the absence of crimes being committed, and therefore both halls have been proposed to be sanctuaries.

In popular culture

 Breidablik is a sacred weapon in Fire Emblem Heroes that the Summoner uses to summon Heroes coming from different Fire Emblem games.
 In the PlayStation game Xenogears, Bledavik is the name of the capital city of the desert kingdom of Aveh on the Ignas continent.

"Wei (), known in historiography as Zhai Wei (), was a dynastic state of China ruled by the Dingling people that existed from 388 to 392, during the Sixteen Kingdoms period of Chinese history. Its founder Zhai Liao had previously been vacillating between being a vassal of the Later Yan, Western Yan, and Eastern Jin dynasties, and in 388, after his last overture to reconcile with Later Yan's emperor Murong Chui was rejected, he founded his own dynasty, over the territory of modern central and eastern Henan. In 392, Zhai Wei, then under Zhai Liao's son Zhai Zhao, was destroyed by Later Yan forces. Because of its relatively small size and short lifespan, Zhai Wei is not included by historians among the Sixteen Kingdoms.

The rulers of Zhai Wei used the title ""Heavenly King"" (Tian Wang).

"NAT Port Mapping Protocol (NAT-PMP) is a network protocol for establishing network address translation (NAT) settings and port forwarding configurations automatically without user effort. The protocol automatically determines the external IPv4 address of a NAT gateway, and provides means for an application to communicate the parameters for communication to peers. Apple introduced NAT-PMP in 2005 by as part of the Bonjour specification, as an alternative to the more common ISO Standard Internet Gateway Device Protocol implemented in many NAT routers. The protocol was published as an informational Request for Comments (RFC) by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in RFC 6886.

NAT-PMP runs over the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and uses port number 5351.  It has no built-in authentication mechanisms because forwarding a port typically does not allow any activity that could not also be achieved using STUN methods. The benefit of NAT-PMP over STUN is that it does not require a STUN server and a NAT-PMP mapping has a known expiration time, allowing the application to avoid sending inefficient keep-alive packets.

NAT-PMP is the predecessor to the Port Control Protocol (PCP).

"Empress Wang Shen'ai (; 384 – 3 October 412), formally Empress Anxi (安僖皇后, literally ""the peaceful and careful empress"") was an empress of Jin Dynasty (266–420).  Her husband was the developmentally disabled Emperor An.

Life 
Wang Shen'ai was the daughter of the official Wang Xianzhi, the son of the famed official and calligrapher Wang Xizhi. Her mother Princess Xin'an was the daughter of Emperor Jianwen, making her and her husband cousins.  In 396, while he was still crown prince under his father Emperor Xiaowu, they married, and she became crown empress.  She was 12, and he was 14.  As he was described to be so developmentally disabled that he could not speak or dress himself, or express whether he was full or hungry, it was unlikely that their marriage was consummated; in any case, they had no children.  Later that year, after Emperor Xiaowu was killed by his concubine Honoured Lady Zhang after humiliating her, Emperor An became emperor. On 3 May 397, she was created empress.

Very little is known about Empress Wang's life as empress. In 403, after Emperor An's throne was usurped by the warlord Huan Xuan, she was effectively put under house arrest with her husband. In 404, after Liu Yu started a rebellion to reestablish Jin, Huan Xuan had her and her husband transported west with him after he resolved to flee west from the capital Jiankang, but on the way, Huan Xuan's brother-in-law Yin Zhongwen (殷仲文) rebelled against him and transported her and Emperor Mu's Empress He Fani back to Jiankang. Later that year, after Huan Xuan was killed and Emperor An was seized back from Huan Xuan's nephew Huan Zhen (桓振), he was reunited with her. She died in  September or October 412 and was buried with honors due an empress.

"Barrow Gurney Reservoirs () (also known as Barrow Gurney Tanks or Barrow Tanks) are three artificial reservoirs for drinking water near the village of Barrow Gurney, which lies southwest of Bristol, England. They are known by their numbers rather than names.

They are fed by several springs including one which becomes the Land Yeo. Some of the outfall is also used to feed the river which flows to the Bristol Channel.

There are three reservoirs in total, one (Tank number three,  to the north of the A38 and two (Tank number one,  and number two,  to the south.

The reservoirs are operated by Bristol Water. The first opened in 1852 to store the water from the newly finished ""Line of Works"", but within two years it developed a leak and had to be drained for repair, causing serious disruption to Bristol's water supply. Over the following decades, work was undertaken to improve the water quality. First with sand filters and in 1935 with chlorination

During 1962 maximum output was increased from  to  a day by lowering the outlet of the filtered tank and duplicating inlets to the seven filters which received microstrained water.

The stony banks on all the tanks provide a habitat for sedges.

Fishing (under permit) is generally for rainbow (Oncorhynchus mykiss, formerly Salmo iridia) and Brown trout (Salmo trutta morpha fario and S. trutta morpha lacustris).

"The Agra Canal is an important Indian irrigation work which starts from Okhla in Delhi. The Agra canal originates at the Okhla barrage, downstream of Nizamuddin bridge. 

The canal receives its water from the Yamuna River at Okhla, about  to the south of New Delhi. The weir across the Yamuna was constructed of locally quarried stone. It was about  long, and rises seven feet above the summer level of the river.

From Okhla the canal follows a route south then southeast for  in the high land between the Khari-Nadi and the Yamuna and finally joins the Utanga River about  below Agra. Navigable branches connect the canal with Mathura and Agra.
The canal irrigates about  in Agra, and Mathura in Uttar Pradesh, Faridabad in Haryana, Bharatpur in Rajasthan and also some parts of Delhi.

History
The canal opened in the year 1874. In the beginning, it was available for navigation, in Delhi, erstwhile Gurgaon, Mathura and Agra Districts, and Bharatpur State. Later, navigation was stopped in 1904 and the canal has, since then, been exclusively used for irrigation purposes only. At present, the canal does not flow in Gurgaon district, but only in Faridabad, which was earlier a part of Gurgaon.

In recent times, Agra canal is an important landmark which separates Greater Faridabad from Faridabad.

"Hyperolius argus, known under common names Argus reed frog, Argus sedge frog, and Boror reed frog (and many others) is a hyperolid frog found in the eastern coastal plain of Africa from southern Somalia through Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique, Malawi, Zimbabwe to KwaZulu-Natal in eastern South Africa.

Description
Hyperolius argus is sexually dichromatic: adult males are usually green, and females usually reddish-brown with large white spots. The coloration and pattern show geographic variation.

Both females and males metamorphose to a solid green color without spots—the color of adult males. Under experimental conditions, the time from metamorphosis to the change to a female color pattern took about two months; for a male, the time from metamorphosis to the development of vocal sacs, with spontaneous vocalization and aggression, was about three months.

The females attach the eggs to vegetation below the surface of the water (possibly caused by raising water level). The female can lay in total about 200 eggs in clusters of about 30 eggs.

Habitat and conservation
Hyperolius argus is a common species living near water in low elevation dense, humid savanna and grassland. Breeding takes place in vegetated shallow pans, vleis and marshes, typically in temporary water.

Even though this species does not face major threats, it is affected by urban expansion, agricultural intensification, and introduced species (bass).

Thus, although Huayna Capac named the infant Ninan Cuyochi as his first heir, sources differ as to whether the boy died first, was unacceptable because of an unfavorable divination, or even if Huayna simply forgot that he had named him when asked to confirm the nomination.  In any event a second choice was requested and again sources vary.  He may have named Huáscar half-brother Atahualpa who then refused, or named Huáscar himself, or perhaps even the nobles put forward Huáscar.

"Corners is a Children's BBC children's television series of the 1980s. Produced by Alison Stewart, the format of the programme was that viewers would submit questions and queries (usually general knowledge, but sometimes metaphysical or scientific), and the two hosts, Tracy Brabin (later Sophie Aldred and then Diane-Louise Jordan) and Simon Davies, would try to answer the questions, aided by an anthropomorphised animal puppet, Jo Corner, who was performed and puppeteered by Robin Stevens (who later performed as Tom on Ragdoll's Tots TV). Being children's programming, the explanations used humour to convey information and frequently involved demonstrations which degenerated into slapstick humour.  Songs were also used.  A show with a similar format, ""Dear Mr. Barker"", aired on CBBC in the mid-1990s, but did not last long.

One of the presenters of the show was Sophie Aldred, who later became famous for playing the role of Ace in the television series Doctor Who (in one segment prior to her involvement in Who, Aldred met Keff McCulloch to discover how the new Doctor Who theme tune was composed). The other was Simon Davies, whose career continues as a writer and performer.

"Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie () is the title of Éliphas Lévi's first published treatise on ritual magic, which appeared in two volumes between 1854 (Dogme) and 1856 (Rituel). Each volume is structured into 22 chapters, which parallel the tarot.

Translations
Lévi's Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie was translated into English by Arthur Edward Waite as Transcendental Magic, its Doctrine and Ritual (1896). Waite added a biographical preface and footnotes. A revised edition of this translation was published in 1923.

A second translation, The Doctrine and Ritual of High Magic: A New Translation, by John Michael Greer and Mark Mikituk, was published in 2017 by TarcherPerigee.

Response

Modern
The work has recently attracted the attention of scholars for its views on the study of magic, religion, natural science and alchemy. Lévi sees magic as occupying a place between science and religion and believes that it has the potential to act as a conciliatory or mediating function between the two views. Lévi rejects views, such as E. B. Taylor's, that magic or religion is inherently irrational and has been superseded by modern science. Instead he posits magic as an ""esoteric science"" and suggests that Hermeticism could be adapted to find the underlying truth behind all magical systems, calling for a ""comparative magic."" Levi thus posits a type of Perennialism buttressed by comparative theology and comparative religion, anticipating modern-day religious studies and paralleling contemporary comparative projects in anthropology and philology such as the work of Max Müller.

"Dave Line (1942 – 1980) was a British beer author. An electrical engineer by profession, he is regarded as a pioneer in homebrewing during the 1970s because at the time homebrewing as a hobby was in its infancy. At the time of his early death from cancer he was 37, living in Southampton, was married and had a son.

Homebrewing
In 1963, it had become free to homebrew in the UK, previously requiring an annual 5 Shilling licence, but would not yet become legal in the U.S. until President Jimmy Carter signed a bill into law in 1978 legalizing it.

People wanted to brew beer that matched the quality of commercial beer. In his first book ""The Big Book of Brewing"", Dave Line helped people to begin to reach the quality they were looking for, by using ingredients and processes that were used in breweries, with simple homebrewing equipment.

At the time people were not getting satisfactory results, because they were using substandard ingredients, low quality syrups or beer kits, baker's yeast, and were not technically informed in the processes of brewing. He advocated the use of proper brewer's yeast, whole-grain barley malts, whole hops, and even went into simple analysis and comparison of the chemistry of water used for brewing different beers, and rudimentary water treatment. He also encouraged sterilisation and proper cleaning of equipment.

He was a regular contributor to Amateur Winemaker, and in a decade, probably had more recipes published than anyone else.

In 1982, he didn't play any of the games. As a novice, he was mainly included in the touring party to get valuable experience in English conditions. He played two games in 1986, 2 more in 1990. Overall, he performed admirably with the ball, taking five wickets for 114 runs at an average of 22.80 per wicket. His best, 2/27 helped Bangladesh win a vital 2nd round match against Canada in 1990.

Other matches
As a bowler, his greatest moment came at Dhaka in January 1984. He took 6/10 (including a hat-trick) against Singapore in the opening match of the 1984 South-East Asia Cup. He was a consistent performer in domestic cricket throughout the 1980s. He is considered one of the best Bangladeshi players of the 1980s.

"A lint roller or lint remover is a roll of one-sided adhesive paper on a cardboard or plastic barrel that is mounted on a central spindle, with an attached handle.  The device facilitates the removal of lint or other small fibers from most materials such as clothing, upholstery and linen. Once expended, the roll can typically be replaced with a ""refill"" roll. Invented in 1956 by Nicholas McKay, Sr., his most well-known (and first commercial) product was the Lint Pic-Up, the world's first lint roller.

Reusable lint rollers use elastomers, including silicones and polystyrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene as a reusable tacky surface. 
The material is similar to polymers used in walking toys such as Wacky WallWalker.

A lint roller's design enables fast 360 degree rotation, which facilitates the easy removal of unsightly fiber (often animal hair). Lint rollers can be purchased in many sizes, from pet stores, supermarkets and online.

The product is popular among dog and cat owners, as it will also remove dog and cat hair from fabrics, carpets etc.

A similar device, the lint brush uses a fabric cushion mounted to a handle, that when rubbed one way across the fabric to be cleaned, picks up the small fibers. By reversing the direction of movement across the fabric or by picking off the excess lint, it is possible to clean the lint brush. Some lint brushes are double sided in order to allow the brush to be used in both directions and to extend the use of the brush by limiting wear.

It contains several species of flower known generally as checkerblooms or checkermallows, or prairie mallows in the United Kingdom.  They can be annuals or perennials, some rhizomatous.  They are native to West and Central North America. Mimosa is a genus of about 400 species of herbs and shrubs, in the mimosoid clade of the legume family Fabaceae.  The generic name is derived from the Greek word μιμος (""mimos""), an ""actor"" or ""mime,"" and the feminine suffix –""osa"", ""resembling"", suggesting its 'sensitive leaves' which seem to 'mimic conscious life'. Desmanthus is a genus of flowering plants in the mimosoid clade of the subfamily Caesalpinioideae of the pea family, Fabaceae.  The name is derived from the Greek words δεσμός (""desmos""), meaning ""bundle"", and ἄνθος (""anthos""), meaning ""flower"".  It contains about 24 species of herbs and shrubs that are sometimes described as being suffruiticose and have bipinnate leaves.  ""Desmanthus"" is closely related to ""Leucaena"" and in appearance is similar to ""Neptunia"".  Like ""Mimosa"" and ""Neptunia"", ""Desmanthus"" species fold their leaves in the evening.  They are native to Mexico and North, Central and South America.  Members of the genus are commonly known as bundleflowers.  Donkey beans is another common name and originated in Central America, where ""Desmanthus"" species are highly regarded as fodder for these domestic draught animals.

"Abdurajak Abubakar Janjalani (1959 – December 18, 1998) was a Filipino Islamist militant who was the chief founder and leader of the Abu Sayyaf organization until his death in 1998 by Filipino police. Upon his death his brother, Khadaffy Janjalani, took control of the organization.

Janjalani was born on the Philippine island of Basilan to a Tau Sūg father and a Ilonggo Christian mother; his presumed year of birth, 1959, is still subject to dispute. A former teacher, he studied theology and Arabic in Libya, Syria, and Saudi Arabia during the 1980s.

When he returned to the Philippines in 1990 Janjalani was able to attract many Muslim youth to join his organization. Janjalani was also allegedly given $6 million by Osama bin Laden to establish the organization as an offshoot of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF). Janjalani had allegedly met Bin Laden in Afghanistan in the late 1980s and allegedly fought alongside him against the Soviet Union during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. At the time of his death, he was the country's most wanted man, with a bounty of 1.5 million pesos on his head.

"Gwardamanġa (English: Guardamangia or sometimes incorrectly written as Gwarda Mangia) is a hamlet in Pietà, Malta.  Gwardamanġa is the home of St. Luke's Hospital, Malta's former general public hospital, and Villa Guardamangia, the former home of Queen Elizabeth II. It is also the location where the Rediffusion House is found.

Overview 

At Gwardamanġa one can find the Villa Guardamangia, a large two-storey building, best known for its elaborate porch which is reached by a flight of steps from each side. The first has a convex configuration over which is a wide elliptical arch. Scroll corbels support the lintels of the sides, while a square-headed doorway is set in an elliptical arched recess. On top of the porch are a series of segmentally arched, louvred windows. Other features include semi-circular wrought iron balconies on each side of the porch, louvred windows and a 'remissa' doorway. The façade lacks decoration, apart from a balustraded parapet wall.

The villa was leased by Lord Louis Mountbatten around 1929.  At various times between 1946 and 1953, Queen Elizabeth II stayed at the villa as both Princess and then Queen while her fiancé, and later husband, The Duke of Edinburgh was stationed in Malta as a serving Royal Navy officer.  Philip and Elizabeth lived in Malta for a period between 1949 and 1951, which made Malta the only foreign country in which the Queen ever resided. It has been speculated that her son Charles was conceived here. The Queen re-visited the villa during her state visit to Malta in 1992.

"Sierra Point is an elevated viewpoint on a rocky outcropping of Yosemite National Park, at the eastern end of the valley, below Grizzly Peak, which was accessible through a now-closed trail.

History
The trail used to be quite popular, but was closed after a rock slide in the 1970s. This was John Muir's favorite trail. It is popular in part because it is the only point in the valley from which four major waterfalls can be seen from one vantage point: Vernal Fall, Nevada Fall, Yosemite Falls, and Illilouette Fall.

Following the rock slide, a portion of the trail approximately mid-way to Sierra Point is missing, although it is still possible to reach the point by scrambling over loose ground.  Although the trail is only  long and about  off the valley floor, this hike should not be attempted by beginning hikers due to the difficulty of the missing portions of the trail. In fact, the National Park Service does not recommend that anyone take this trail. Despite this warning, many people still reach the point each year as it is easily accessible from the Vernal Fall trail in Happy Isles, and still has the original railing at the top.

"Karacasu is a municipality and district of Aydın Province, Turkey. Its area is 727 km2, and its population is 17,620 (2022). It is  from the city of Aydın.

Formerly known as ""Yenişehir"", Karacasu is reached by turning off the Aydın - Denizli road south-east at Kuyucak and following the Dandalaz River upstream into the hills. The road is windy and the surrounding countryside is planted with olives, citrus fruits and as you get higher up, pines. 

The ruins of the ancient city of Aphrodisias are located within the boundaries of Karacasu, near the small town of Geyre. The area was first settled in the Bronze Age and reached its peak in the Roman and Byzantine eras as a centre of marble working. The ruins include a stadium, Temple of Aphrodite, theatre, agora and a bath with the heating system still visible. The city also contains the grave of archaeologist Kenan Erim of New York University who did so much to excavate the site. 

The district is also notable for its rich emery mines. 

Karacasu itself is a small town of nearly 6,000 people, and is thought to be the site of the lost city of Gordiouteichos.

"Billbergia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Bromeliaceae, subfamily Bromelioideae.  The genus, named for the Swedish botanist, zoologist, and anatomist Gustaf Johan Billberg, is divided into two subgenera: ""Billbergia"" and ""Helicodea"".  They are native to forest and scrub, up to an altitude of 1,700 m , in southern Mexico, the West Indies, Central America and South America, with many species endemic to Brazil. Tritonia (flame freesia) is a genus of flowering plants in the iris family first described as a genus in 1802.  They are naturally distributed across southern Africa, with a high concentration of species in Cape Province of western South Africa.  The genus is closely related to the genus ""Ixia"". The genus Ixia consists of a number of cormous plants native to South Africa from the Iridaceae family and Ixioideae subfamily.  Some of them are known as the corn lily.

"Dasyproctidae is a family of large South American rodents, comprising the agoutis and acouchis. Their fur is a reddish or dark colour above, with a paler underside. They are herbivorous, often feeding on ripe fruit that falls from trees. They live in burrows, and, like squirrels, will bury some of their food for later use.

Dasyproctids exist in Central and South America, which are the tropical parts of the New World. The fossil record of this family can be traced back to the Late Oligocene (Deseadan in the SALMA classification).

As with all rodents, members of this family have incisors, pre-molars, and molars, but no canines. The cheek teeth are hypsodont and flat-crowned.

"Werauhia nephrolepis is a species in the genus ""Werauhia"".  This species is native to Costa Rica. Plectranthus, with some 350 species, is a genus of warm-climate plants occurring largely in the southern hemisphere, in sub-Saharan Africa, Madagascar, India and the Indonesian archipelago down to Australia and some Pacific Islands.  They are closely related to ""Solenostemon"" and are known as the spurflowers.  Several species are grown as ornamental plants, as leaf vegetables, as root vegetables for their edible tubers, or as medicine. Nephrolepis is a genus of about 30 species of ferns in the family Nephrolepidaceae (or Dryopteridaceae in some classifications). Solenostemon, commonly known as ""Coleus"" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lamiaceae.  Several species formerly included have been moved to the genus ""Plectranthus"".  They are native to tropical Africa, Asia and Australia.  Some species are cultivated for their highly variegated leaves. Coleus is a former genus of flowering plants in the family Lamiaceae.  In recent classifications, the genus is no longer recognized, and the formerly included species are instead placed in the genera ""Plectranthus"" and ""Solenostemon"".  Because the type species, Coleus amboinicus (""Plectranthus amboinicus"") is now placed in ""Plectranthus"", ""Coleus"" is regarded as a synonym of ""Plectranthus"".  The term ""coleus"" is often used as a common name for species formerly placed in the genus ""Coleus"" that are cultivated as ornamental plants, particularly Coleus blumei (""Plectranthus scutellarioides""), which is popular as a garden plant for its brightly colored foliage.",Answer the following question based on the context: Which genus has more species Nephrolepis or Plectranthus ?,

"Burundi's relations with its neighbours have often been affected by security concerns. Hundreds of thousands of Burundian refugees have at various times crossed to neighboring Rwanda, Tanzania, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Hundreds of thousands of Burundians are in neighboring countries as a result of the ongoing civil war. Most of them, more than 340,000 since 1993, are in Tanzania. Some Burundian rebel groups have used neighboring countries as bases for insurgent activities. The 1993 embargo placed on Burundi by regional states hurt diplomatic relations with its neighbors; relations have improved since the 1999 suspension of these sanctions.

Burundi is a member of various international and regional organizations, including the United Nations, the African Union, the African Development Bank and the Francophonie. The Swedish Minister for Integration and Gender Equality, Nyamko Sabuni, was born in Burundi.

"An ice cream bar is a frozen dessert featuring ice cream on a stick. The confection was patented in the US in the 1920s, with one invalidated in 1928.

Description 
An ice cream bar is a frozen dessert on a stick. It features ice cream, distinguishing it from an ice pop, which does not contain any ice cream.

History

In the US, the Eskimo Pie chocolate bar was invented in Iowa by a pharmacy owner named Chris Nelson, who was inspired by a boy named Douglas Ressenden who could not decide between candy and ice cream. They were named ""I-Scream-Bars"" in the original test run. One of the earliest advertisements for Eskimo Pies appeared in the November 3, 1921 issue of the Iowa City Press-Citizen. A patent was awarded in 1922, but invalidated in 1928.

According to the Good Humor ice cream company, confectioner Harry Burt invented ice cream on a stick in 1920, and was granted a patent in 1923. This product also was enrobed in chocolate, and other products were produced.

"Fumo Madi ibn Abi Bakr was Sultan of Pate, Kenya (1779 - 1809).
Around 1800 the Pate Sultan took over Lamu, however, they were deeply resented by the people of Lamu. Fumomadi was persuaded (""by a faithful old advisor"") to build a fort on the seafront in Lamu Town, to protect members of his government.

There was much disagreement over choosing his successor, as he had fifty children and all sons and male ín-laws were eligible for the throne. After ""encouragement"" from the powerful Mazrui family from Mombasa/Oman, an in-law named Ahmad ibn Shaykh was chosen as the next Sultan.
