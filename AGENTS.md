Do test driven development. Cavet: only do this when the feature you're implementing is hard, not when it's straight forward.
Write typescript tests after implementing features with bun:test.
Write python tests after impmlementing features with pytest.
Don't create "example" scripts.
Don't create .md files to explain what you implemented. Instead, convey that information in your final response.
Don't write print statements with `=`s.
When asking clarifying questions about the codebase, I prefer concise responses.
